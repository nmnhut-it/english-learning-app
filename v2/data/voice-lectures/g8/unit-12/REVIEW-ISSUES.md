### Dialogue has WRONG character names

**Source dialogue:** Mai and Nick about book "A journey back to Soduka"
```
Mai: What book are you reading, Nick?
Nick: A journey back to Soduka. I'm on the last page.
Mai: That's a science fiction book, isn't it? What's it about?

4. The four creatures travel to Earth again to visit Tommy. (F - forced by commander)
5. The novel makes Nick and Mai think about the possibility that Earth might be attacked by aliens. (T)
