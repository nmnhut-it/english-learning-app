## communication.md - COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED

### Bài 1 - Dialogues are WRONG

**Source Dialogue 1:**
```
Mark: Now, about the video conference ... Everyone must be here at 9:30 a.m., and ...
Trang: Sorry for interrupting, but I think we should meet at 9:00 a.m. We need to test the devices.
```

**Voice lecture (FABRICATED):**
```
Amy: So, our main topic today is digital communication in schools...
Ben: Sorry for interrupting, but I think we missed a point...
```

**Source Dialogue 2:**
```
Nick: This webcam is easy to handle. You click these buttons to move it up or down and these to ...
Lan: Hold on. Can you repeat that, please?
```

**Voice lecture (FABRICATED):**
```
Student A: I think emojis help people of all ages express emotions...
Student B: Exactly! A smiley face can replace words...
```

### Bài 2 - Situations are WRONG

**Source situations:**
1. Student A telling student B how to make a video call. Student B interrupts to ask for clarification.
2. Student A telling student B the place for their next meeting. Student B interrupts to suggest another place.

**Voice lecture (FABRICATED):** 3 completely different situations about wrong information, teacher questions, and disagreeing in discussion.

### Bài 3 - Format is WRONG

**Source:** Reading passage (Mark's prediction about emojis) + 5 questions:
1. What means of communication is Mark talking about?
2. When will emojis become more commonly used?
3. Who will be using them?
4. How will they help in communication?
5. Why will they become more popular?

**Voice lecture (FABRICATED):** True/False questions instead of reading comprehension.

### Bài 4 - MISSING

**Source:** Choose one means of communication (Automatic translation function OR Chatbot) and ask/answer questions about it.

### Bài 5 - MISSING

**Source:** Report your pair's conversation to the class by making a similar talk to Mark's prediction in 3.
