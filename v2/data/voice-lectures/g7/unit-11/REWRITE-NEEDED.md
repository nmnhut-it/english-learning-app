# G7 Unit 11 - Voice Lectures Need Complete Rewrite

## Problem Summary
All voice lecture files in this unit are **incomplete answer-only files** that do not follow the proper voice lecture schema used in other units (e.g., Unit 9, Unit 10).

## What's Missing
- Proper `<task>` tags with exercise instructions (English + Vietnamese translation)
- Proper `<questions>` tags with actual questions
- Detailed `<answer>` and `<explanation>` tags
- Meaningful teacher_script content (current ones are generic boilerplate)
- Southern Vietnamese casual tone

## Current State
Files currently just contain:
- Generic intro/outro teacher scripts
- Brief vocabulary lists
- Answer keys without the questions

## Specific Fabrication Issues to Fix

### A Closer Look 1
- **Bai 2:** Remove fabricated "a horse, a bike, a car" - source only has "hyperloop, skyTran" for ride
- **Bai 3:** Swap answers #2 and #3 - should be "2. ride, 3. fly" not "2. fly, 3. ride"

### A Closer Look 2
- **Remove random text:** "Dat, Dang, Thai x3", "Khiet x2, Khang x1", "Bao An, Vinh x2" (classroom notes)

### Getting Started
- **Bai 5 #4:** Change "boat" to "sailing boat"
