    "brief": "## CÂU TƯỜNG THUẬT (REPORTED SPEECH)\n\n### 1. Câu tường thuật là gì?\n\nCâu tường thuật (Reported Speech) là cách kể lại lời nói của người khác mà **không dùng nguyên văn**.\n\n**Ví dụ thực tế:**\n- Bạn hỏi: \"Hôm qua Lan nói gì?\"\n- Bạn trả lời: \"Lan **nói rằng cô ấy bị ốm**.\" (không phải \"Lan nói: Tôi bị ốm\")\n\n**Câu trực tiếp (Direct Speech):** Trích dẫn nguyên văn, có dấu ngoặc kép\n- \"I am tired,\" she said. → \"Tôi mệt,\" cô ấy nói.\n\n**Câu tường thuật (Reported Speech):** Kể lại, không có dấu ngoặc kép\n- She said (that) she was tired. → Cô ấy nói rằng cô ấy mệt.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SAID vs TOLD - Phân biệt quan trọng nhất ⚠️\n\nĐây là lỗi phổ biến nhất của học sinh! Hãy nhớ:\n\n| Động từ | Cách dùng | Ví dụ đúng | Ví dụ sai ❌ |\n|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|\n| **SAID** | Không có người nghe | He **said** he was tired. | ~~He said me...~~ |\n| **TOLD** | CÓ người nghe (me/him/her/us/them) | He **told me** he was tired. | ~~He told that...~~ |\n\n**Quy tắc vàng:**\n- ✅ **SAID** + (that) + clause: *She said (that) she was happy.*\n- ✅ **TOLD** + người nghe + (that) + clause: *She told me (that) she was happy.*\n- ❌ **SAID** + người nghe: ~~She said me that...~~ → SAI!\n- ❌ **TOLD** + không người nghe: ~~She told that...~~ → SAI!\n\n**Cách nhớ:**\n- SAID = nói (một mình, không rõ nói với ai)\n- TOLD = nói với ai đó (phải có người nghe)\n\n**Thêm ví dụ:**\n- The doctor **said** the patient was getting better. (Không rõ nói với ai)\n- The doctor **told us** the patient was getting better. (Nói với \"us\" = chúng tôi)\n- My mom **said** she would cook dinner. (Không có người nghe cụ thể)\n- My mom **told me** she would cook dinner. (Nói với \"me\" = tôi)\n\n---\n\n### 3. LÙI THÌ ĐỘNG TỪ (Tense Backshift)\n\nKhi chuyển từ câu trực tiếp sang tường thuật, động từ thường **lùi về một thì**:\n\n| Câu trực tiếp | Câu tường thuật | Ví dụ |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------|\n| **am/is** | → was | \"I **am** happy.\" → She said she **was** happy. |\n| **are** | → were | \"We **are** studying.\" → They said they **were** studying. |\n| **have/has** | → had | \"I **have** a headache.\" → He said he **had** a headache. |\n| **do/does** | → did | \"I **don't** know.\" → She said she **didn't** know. |\n| **will** | → would | \"I **will** help.\" → He said he **would** help. |\n| **can** | → could | \"I **can** swim.\" → She said she **could** swim. |\n| **may** | → might | \"I **may** come.\" → He said he **might** come. |\n| **must** | → had to | \"You **must** rest.\" → She said I **had to** rest. |\n| **Present simple** | → Past simple | \"I **like** pizza.\" → He said he **liked** pizza. |\n| **Present continuous** | → Past continuous | \"I**'m working**.\" → She said she **was working**. |\n| **Present perfect** | → Past perfect | \"I **have finished**.\" → He said he **had finished**. |\n\n**Lưu ý:** `should`, `could`, `would`, `might` **KHÔNG đổi**:\n- \"You should rest.\" → The doctor said I **should** rest. (giữ nguyên)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ĐỔI ĐẠI TỪ (Pronoun Changes)\n\nĐại từ phải đổi theo ngữ cảnh:\n\n| Câu trực tiếp | Câu tường thuật | Giải thích |\n|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| **I** | → he/she | Người nói trở thành \"anh ấy/cô ấy\" |\n| **me** | → him/her | |\n| **my** | → his/her | |\n| **we** | → they | |\n| **us** | → them | |\n| **our** | → their | |\n| **you** (người nghe) | → I/me/we/us | Tùy ngữ cảnh |\n| **your** | → my/our | |\n\n**Ví dụ chi tiết:**\n- \"**I** love **my** job.\" → She said **she** loved **her** job.\n- \"**You** must help **me**.\" → He told me **I** had to help **him**.\n- \"**We** are doing **our** homework.\" → They said **they** were doing **their** homework.\n\n---\n\n### 5. ĐỔI TỪ CHỈ THỜI GIAN VÀ NƠI CHỐN\n\n| Câu trực tiếp | Câu tường thuật |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| **today** | → that day |\n| **tonight** | → that night |\n| **tomorrow** | → the next day / the following day |\n| **yesterday** | → the day before / the previous day |\n| **next week** | → the following week |\n| **last week** | → the week before / the previous week |\n| **now** | → then |\n| **here** | → there |\n| **this** | → that |\n| **these** | → those |\n| **ago** | → before |\n\n**Ví dụ:**\n- \"I'll come **tomorrow**.\" → He said he would come **the next day**.\n- \"I saw her **yesterday**.\" → She said she had seen her **the day before**.\n- \"I'm busy **now**.\" → He said he was busy **then**.\n- \"I like **this** book.\" → She said she liked **that** book.\n- \"I came **here** two days **ago**.\" → He said he had come **there** two days **before**.\n\n---\n\n### 6. HƯỚNG DẪN CHUYỂN ĐỔI TỪNG BƯỚC\n\n**Ví dụ:** \"I am feeling sick today.\" (Mary told the nurse)\n\n**Bước 1:** Xác định động từ tường thuật\n- Có người nghe (the nurse) → dùng **TOLD**\n\n**Bước 2:** Đổi đại từ\n- \"I\" → \"she\" (vì Mary là nữ)\n\n**Bước 3:** Lùi thì động từ\n- \"am feeling\" → \"was feeling\"\n\n**Bước 4:** Đổi từ chỉ thời gian\n- \"today\" → \"that day\"\n\n**Kết quả:** Mary **told the nurse** she **was feeling** sick **that day**.\n\n---\n\n### 7. CÁC LỖI THƯỜNG GẶP ❌\n\n| Lỗi sai | Sửa đúng | Giải thích |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| ~~He said me that...~~ | He **told me** that... | SAID không đi với tân ngữ |\n| ~~She told that...~~ | She **said** that... | TOLD cần có người nghe |\n| ~~He told to me that...~~ | He **told me** that... | TOLD không có \"to\" |\n| ~~She said she is tired.~~ | She said she **was** tired. | Phải lùi thì |\n| ~~He said he can help.~~ | He said he **could** help. | can → could |\n| ~~They said they will come tomorrow.~~ | They said they **would** come **the next day**. | will → would, tomorrow → the next day |\n\n---\n\n### 8. MẸO GHI NHỚ 💡\n\n1. **SAID vs TOLD:** \"TOLD cần có người nghe\" - nhớ chữ T: **T**OLD = **T**elling someone\n\n2. **Lùi thì:** Hãy tưởng tượng đang kể chuyện đã xảy ra → mọi thứ đều ở quá khứ\n\n3. **Đổi đại từ:** Đặt mình vào vị trí người kể lại - \"I\" của người nói trở thành \"he/she\"\n\n4. **Từ chỉ thời gian:** today/tomorrow/yesterday → thêm \"that day/next day/day before\" (vì thời điểm đã khác)",

      "\"I will help you.\" → She told me she would help me. | Cô ấy nói với tôi rằng cô ấy sẽ giúp tôi. (will→would, I→she, you→me)",
