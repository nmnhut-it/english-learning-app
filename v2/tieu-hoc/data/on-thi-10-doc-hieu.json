This was the case as regards two students in my class at college. Both of them were exceptionally bright, but in the final year \"exam\" neither of them got an A grade. In fact, they both got Cs. The exam had tested us on questions which had come up the previous year. They had both assumed that the same questions wouldn't come up again, and hadn't prepared for them.",

The streets are always full of cars and trucks; you can never find a place to park.\n\nTravelling around is never easy in the city. If you have enough money, you can take a taxi. New York cabs are yellow. They look all the same. But the drivers are very different. Some were born and raised in New York, but many are newcomers to the United States.\n\nA few drive slowly, but most go very fast. Cab driving is a difficult job. It can be dangerous, too. Thieves often try to steal the drivers' money. Drivers sometimes get hurt.\n\nIf you don't want to take a taxi, you can go by bus or you can take the subway. The subway is quick and it's cheap, but some of its parts are old and dirty. Lights don't always work and there are often fires on the track. On some subway lines, there are new, clean and silver trains. But you can't see the color of the old trains easily. There is too much dirt and too much graffiti, inside and outside.",

But I'll never forget my first personal experience with the strangeness of nature – \"the London Killer Fog\" of 1952. It began on Thursday, December 4th when a high-pressure system (warm air) covered southern England. With the freezing-cold air below, heavy fog formed. Pollution from factories, cars, and coal stoves mixed with the fog. The humidity was terribly high, there was no breeze at all. Traffic (cars, trains, and boats) stopped. People couldn't see, and some walked onto the railroad tracks or into the river. It was hard to breathe, and many people got sick. Finally on Tuesday, December 9th, the wind came and the fog went away. But after that, even more people got sick, many of them died.",
