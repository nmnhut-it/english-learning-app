## Verification Plan

### Overview
This document tracks the progress of verifying and improving the English learning app content by:
1. Comparing markdown files in `markdown-files/global-success-X` with ground truth in `ground-truth/gX`
2. Verifying content accuracy against Vietnamese educational sources (VietJack, LoiGiaiHay)
3. Incorporating real vocabulary and answers from ground truth files
4. Ensuring all exercises strictly follow authentic sources

### Verification Process for Each Grade
1. **Inventory Check**: List all units and review files
2. **Ground Truth Analysis**: Extract vocabulary and answers from ground-truth files
3. **Content Verification**: 
   - Check each exercise against VietJack/LoiGiaiHay
   - Identify any "cooked up" or inaccurate content
   - Verify vocabulary matches the syllabus
4. **Integration**: Merge ground truth content with markdown files
5. **Quality Check**: Final review of corrected content
