# English Learning App Content Verification Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of verifying and correcting the English learning app content against ground truth data and Vietnamese educational sources (VietJack, LoiGiaiHay).

## Verification Plan

### Phase 1: Structure Analysis and Comparison
1. **Map content structure** between markdown-files and ground-truth
2. **Identify discrepancies** in unit numbering and file naming
3. **Create comparison templates** for systematic review

### Phase 2: Content Verification Process
For each grade level (7, 8, 9):
1. **Compare vocabulary lists** - Ensure ground truth vocab is incorporated
2. **Verify exercises** against Vietnamese sources
3. **Check answers** for accuracy
4. **Flag suspicious content** that may be "cooked up"
5. **Make corrections** while preserving file structure

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **Cross-reference** with VietJack and LoiGiaiHay
2. **Validate** exercise authenticity
3. **Ensure** student-appropriate content based on ground truth
