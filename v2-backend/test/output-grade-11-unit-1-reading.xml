          <answer status="provided">I find the advice about healthy eating very useful. I usually avoid eating food with too much salt or sugar, and try to eat more fruit and vegetables. But I don't pay much attention to food labels. I think I'll try to read them from now on before I buy any food items.

The last piece of advice is most useful for me. I avoid having coffee or tea before bed, but I keep reading messages and posts on my phone in bed, and then find it hard to fall asleep. I think this is an unhealthy habit. I'll try to turn off my phone before I go to bed in the future.</answer>
