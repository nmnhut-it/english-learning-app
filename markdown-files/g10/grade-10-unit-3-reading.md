### Reading Text

American Idol was shown for the first time on television in January 2002. At that time, there were many movies and TV series, but no reality competitions on TV. The participants in this programme are ordinary people who the audience can really identify with.

First, judges travel all around America in search of the best singers and bring them to Hollywood. Twenty-four to thirty-six participants are then chosen to go on to the next stages where they perform live on TV, and receive the judges' opinions. From the semi-final onwards, people over 13 and living in the US, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands can vote for their preferred singers online or through text messaging. The singer with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. On the final night, the most popular singer becomes the winner of that American Idol season.

People watch American Idol not only to see the participants sing, but also hear the comments of the judges, who play an important role in the competition. Their different opinions and interesting arguments make the show very exciting.

The first season of Vietnam Idol was shown in 2007. It included three stages: short performances to choose participants, semi-finals and finals. The winners of the show's different seasons have become famous singers in Viet Nam.
