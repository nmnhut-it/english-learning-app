Since UNICEF set up an office in 1975 in Viet Nam, it has run projects in various fields to provide the highest possible support for children in our country. The organisation particularly aims to create opportunities for all children in Viet Nam to attend school, learn and succeed. The following programmes help achieve the UNICEF's education aims for Viet Nam.

UNICEF helps disadvantaged teenagers continue their education by offering them job training and career advice. They are also taught essential skills for the job market.

This programme gives children with disabilities a chance to get access to and benefit from a quality education. It also helps promote equal participation in society and a culture in which people respect each other.

This is another practical programme supported by UNICEF. The aim is to better prepare children for the challenges in the future.
