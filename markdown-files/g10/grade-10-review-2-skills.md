Imagine living in a house where everything is controlled from a distance.
The doors and windows open and close not with keys, but with your voice commands.
The lights turn on when you enter the room, and then turn off as you leave.
The alarm rings when someone breaks into your house, and the police are immediately informed and on their way.
You can even control your house temperature, lights, and devices from a mobile phone when you are far from home.
That is what we call a smart home.
And that's how technology can make our life at home more enjoyable and comfortable than ever.

## III. Reading

### Exercise 1: Match the highlighted words with their meanings

**Text:**
There are two types of community service. The first one is a kind of punishment. For example, people who litter may be forced to clean up the streets. In this case, they may not feel happy about the work. The second type of community service is **voluntary**. This means people are **willing**, or pleased to do the work. For instance, people may volunteer to build houses for poor people, or raise money for children in mountainous areas.

However, it does not mean that volunteering is always a **selfless** act because volunteers may also benefit from the volunteering activities. For example, they may volunteer to meet new people, to develop social skills, or to find themselves' (learn what they truly want in life). In general, people may volunteer not just to help others, but also to help themselves.

**Match words with meanings:**

| Words | Meanings |
|-------|----------|
| 1. voluntary | a. caring more about other people |
| 2. willing | b. ready to do something |
| 3. selfless | c. done without being forced to do it |

#### Answer Key:
