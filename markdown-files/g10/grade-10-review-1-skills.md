Living a green lifestyle is not difficult, but these small changes will make a big difference.

#### Sample Answer:

There are many ways you can make your life greener. The first possible way is planting more trees and plants. This reduces CO2 and makes the air clean. The second thing we can do is organising regular clean-up activities. This keeps the environment clean and makes it safe for everyone. The next thing can be collecting litter, setting up more recycling bins as this makes the waste collection easier. In addition, turning off electrical devices when not in use is an effective way. This not only helps reduce energy bills but also prevents any dangerous situations such as fire or an explosion.
