**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**

Monday, April 20

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantasy. Its director is Chris Columbus. It is the first of the Harry Potter film series.

Daniel Radcliffe is one of the stars in the film.

The film tells the story of Harry Potter. He's a powerful wizard. He is a student at a school for wizards and learns about himself, his family, and the bad things happening around him.

The film received a lot of good reviews. People say it's a must-see for teens. I agree because the story is gripping and the acting is excellent. The music is also wonderful.

Although Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a little frightening at times, it is very interesting and full of action. Go and see it if you can.

Thứ Hai, ngày 20 tháng 4

Harry Potter và Hòn đá Phù thủy là một câu chuyện giả tưởng. Đạo diễn của phim là Chris Columbus. Đây là phần đầu tiên trong loạt phim Harry Potter.

Daniel Radcliffe là một trong những ngôi sao của bộ phim.

Bộ phim kể câu chuyện về Harry Potter. Cậu ấy là một phù thủy quyền năng. Cậu ấy là một học sinh tại ngôi trường dành cho phù thủy và học về bản thân, gia đình, và những điều xấu xa đang xảy ra xung quanh mình.

Bộ phim nhận được nhiều đánh giá tích cực. Mọi người nói rằng đây là một bộ phim phải xem dành cho thanh thiếu niên. Tôi đồng ý bởi vì câu chuyện rất cuốn hút và diễn xuất thì xuất sắc. Âm nhạc cũng rất tuyệt vời.

Mặc dù Harry Potter và Hòn đá Phù thủy có đôi lúc hơi đáng sợ, nhưng nó rất thú vị và tràn đầy các cảnh hành động. Hãy đi xem nếu bạn có thể.
