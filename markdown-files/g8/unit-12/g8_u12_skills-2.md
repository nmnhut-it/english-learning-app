Question 5  
Creatures living on Star Planet are called Glowbeings. They have three big eyes and a short, round body with four arms. Their skin is smooth and green, which helps them hide in the plants. Glowbeings are very friendly but a little shy when they meet new friends. They sleep all day and wake up at night when the stars come out. These aliens eat small pieces of clouds and drink rain water to stay healthy. Glowbeings can jump ten times higher than humans and have the special power to talk to animals. They live in small houses made of special stones that shine in the dark.
