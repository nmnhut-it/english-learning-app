A village festival day

I live in a small village in northern Viet Nam. Every year, people in my village look forward to the third day of Tet. It is one of our most important festival days.

In the morning, we gather along the riverside to watch some competitions. First, there is a special boat race. Some team members cook rice on the boat while others row the boat as fast as they can. The fastest team with well-cooked rice wins the race. Then, the referee releases a duck into the middle of the river. Contestants jump into the river to catch it. The atmosphere becomes loud with the sound of drums and cheers of festival goers.

At noon, there is a village party at the communal house for the elders. Each family also holds a home party. We cook traditional dishes like sticky rice and steamed chicken. Sometimes, we include food that children love, such as bun cha or even pizzas!

The village festival helps us maintain our traditions, connect with other people, and strengthen our family bonds.
