Dear Tom,

I'm glad to hear that you are going to attend the Ooc-om-bok festival. Here are the dos and don'ts for you.

First, you should dress up nicely for the Moon God offering ceremony. It is advised to show respect to the monks and elders and keep quiet when they are talking.

However, you shouldn't climb on the animal statues in the temple ground or refuse young rice when the elders offer it to you. Also, don't litter the temple ground.

Hope you will have a great time at the festival.
