## I. Everyday English - Giving and Responding to Warnings

### Exercise 1: Listen and Complete the Conversation
Listen and complete the conversation with the expressions in the box. Then practice it in pairs.

**Options:**
- A. Thanks so much
- B. I must warn you
- C. Don't worry
- D. Watch out

#### Dialogue:
**Jane:** Hi, Nga. Is that a coal-burning stove?

**Nga:** Hi. Yes, my dad bought it last week. It heats up our home very quickly. Let me put in some more coal.

**Jane:** (1) _________________! You're too close and will burn yourself!

**Nga:** (2) __________________. I'm very careful.

**Jane:** Yes, it feels very warm, but (3) _____________ burning coal produces soot.

**Nga:** Oh no, I didn't know that. (4) ______________. I'll tell my dad.

#### Answer Key (Đáp án):
1. **D** - Watch out
2. **C** - Don't worry  
3. **B** - I must warn you
4. **A** - Thanks so much

#### Translation (Hướng dẫn dịch):
**Jane:** Chào, Nga. Đó có phải là bếp đốt than không?

**Nga:** Xin chào. Vâng, bố tôi đã mua nó tuần trước. Nó làm nóng nhà của chúng tôi rất nhanh. Để tôi cho thêm ít than vào.

**Jane:** Coi chừng. Bạn đang ở quá gần và sẽ đốt cháy chính mình!

**Nga:** Đừng lo lắng. Tôi rất cẩn thận.

**Jane:** Vâng, cảm giác rất ấm áp, nhưng tôi phải cảnh báo bạn rằng đốt than tạo ra bồ hóng.

**Nga:** Ồ không, tôi không biết điều đó. Cám ơn rất nhiều. Tôi sẽ nói với bố tôi.

### Exercise 2: Work in Pairs - Create Similar Conversations

Work in pairs. Use the model in 1 to make similar conversations for these situations. One of you is Student A, the other is Student B.

#### Situation 1:
Student A is burning rubbish. Student B is warning him/her about the dangers of open waste burning to people's health and the environment.

**Sample Dialogue:**
**Student A:** Hey, have you seen me burning some rubbish here?

**Student B:** Yeah, I see that. But do you know that burning waste like that can be dangerous to people's health and the environment?

**Student A:** Really? How come?

**Student B:** When you burn waste like that, it releases harmful toxins into the air, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. It can also harm the environment and pollute the air and soil.

**Student A:** Oh, I had no idea. Thanks for letting me know. I'll stop doing it and find a proper way to dispose of my waste.

#### Situation 2:
Student B is building a campfire. Student A is warning him/her about the risk of starting a forest fire and the health risks.

**Sample Dialogue:**
**Student B:** Hey, I'm building a campfire. Do you want to join me?

**Student A:** Sure, but be careful. Starting a fire in a forest can be risky, especially if it's dry and windy.

**Student B:** Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

**Student A:** But even a small spark can start a big forest fire, which can be difficult to control and cause a lot of damage. It's also not safe for our health, as the smoke can cause respiratory problems.

**Student B:** I see your point. Maybe we should find a safer spot to make a fire or just use a portable stove instead.

**Student A:** Yes, that's a better idea. We can enjoy our time outdoors without putting ourselves and the environment at risk.

## II. CLIL - Reducing the Environmental Impact of Farming

### Exercise 1: Read and Identify

Read the text and tick (✓) the pictures that show ways to reduce global warming.

#### Reading Text: REDUCING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF FARMING

Farming provides us with the food that we eat every day. But farming activities also have a strong warming impact on the global temperature. The good news is that experts have already started thinking about how to reduce it.

Raising farm animals like cows, goats, and sheep makes the planet hotter. There are billions of them and they release methane, a greenhouse gas that is much more dangerous than carbon dioxide. That is why scientists are developing methane-catching face masks for cows. They are intended to reduce methane emissions by up to 50 per cent per cow.

Another farming activity that heats the atmosphere is growing rice. According to research, emissions from rice farms have the same warming effect as about 600 coal plants. Flooded rice fields also make it easier for soil bacteria to produce greenhouse gases. New farming methods have allowed rice to grow well in drier fields, limit the amount of greenhouse gases, use less water, and produce better crops.

In addition, land-use increases the global temperature. Plants and trees use CO2 to grow and store large amounts of carbon underground. Cutting down or burning forests to create farm fields and land for feeding animals releases tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere every year. Luckily, many countries and world leaders have agreed to protect the forests and end deforestation.

In short, there are some positive signs that farmers can meet the environmental challenges. However, although the impact of farming on the global temperature has been reduced, there is still much to do.

#### Answer Key:
**Good practices (reduce global warming):** Pictures 1, 4
**Bad practices (increase global warming):** Pictures 2, 3, 5

### Exercise 2: Group Discussion

Work in groups. Discuss the following questions:

**Question:** What farming activities in Viet Nam do you think have negative impact on the global temperature? What do you think are the alternatives to those activities?

#### Sample Answer:

There are several farming activities in Vietnam that can have a negative impact on the global temperature, including:

1. **Rice cultivation**
2. **Livestock production**  
3. **Pesticide use**
4. **Deforestation**

To address these negative impacts, some alternatives that can be considered include:

1. **Sustainable rice cultivation**
2. **Improved livestock management**
3. **Organic farming**
4. **Forest conservation and reforestation**

Overall, a shift towards sustainable agriculture practices and land use management can help to mitigate the negative impacts of farming activities on the global temperature.

#### Translation (Hướng dẫn dịch):

Có một số hoạt động nông nghiệp ở Việt Nam có thể có tác động tiêu cực đến nhiệt độ toàn cầu, bao gồm:

1. **Trồng lúa**
2. **Chăn nuôi**
3. **Sử dụng thuốc trừ sâu**
4. **Phá rừng**

Để giải quyết những tác động tiêu cực này, một số giải pháp thay thế có thể được xem xét bao gồm:

1. **Canh tác lúa bền vững**
2. **Cải thiện quản lý chăn nuôi**
3. **Canh tác hữu cơ**
4. **Bảo tồn rừng và trồng lại rừng**

Nhìn chung, sự thay đổi hướng tới thực hành nông nghiệp bền vững và quản lý sử dụng đất có thể giúp giảm thiểu tác động tiêu cực của các hoạt động nông nghiệp đối với nhiệt độ toàn cầu.
