TV host: Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Teens' World. Today we have in our studio Dr. Janet Harrison. She's a psychologist who has worked on teen issues for many years. Welcome to our program, Dr. Harrison.

Dr. Harrison: Thank you for having me here.

TV host: You told us that you'd like to discuss a serious teen problem today. What's it?

Dr. Harrison: Well, it's body shaming - the act of making fun of someone because of his or her appearance.

TV host: Oh, I recall being called 'fat' and 'ugly' by one of my classmates when I was at secondary school. Is this an example of body shaming?

Dr. Harrison: I'm sorry to hear that, and yes, it is. Although body shaming is not a new topic, it has recently become more common. You see, as more and more young people are using the Internet, body shaming happens mainly online now. People often post offensive comments or photos about others, and invite others to join them.

**Article:**

**A. __________________________**

As the oldest national park in Viet Nam, Cuc Phuong is a natural habitat of many rare animals and plants in Asia. It is estimated that over 2,000 plant species and thousands of species of animals live in the 22,000-hectare ecosystem. The park also has the largest variety of birds in northern Viet Nam with more than 3,000 bird species.

**B. __________________________**

The rich ecosystem of Cuc Phuong attracts many nature lovers from all over the world. The park is very popular from April to May, when visitors have a chance to see more than 400 species of colourful butterflies in the forest. That's why it has won the award of Asia's Leading National Park several times.

**C. __________________________**

Despite the government's effort to protect Cuc Phuong, several problems have been reported. Small parts of the park have been destroyed as people have cut down old trees without permission. In addition, rare animals were hunted illegally, some of which were fortunately rescued and returned to the forest. There are still irresponsible tourists who drop litter on the trails, which pollutes the water and soil. These actions can damage the ecosystem of the park. Therefore, tougher measures should be taken to protect the biodiversity of the area.
