# Unit 6: Preserving our heritage - Reading

## Teenagers' ideas for preserving heritage

### Exercise 1: Work in pairs. Ask and answer the question.

**Question:** Why is it important to protect our heritage?

#### Suggested Answer (Lời giải chi tiết):

It is important to protect our heritage for several reasons. Firstly, our heritage represents our history and our culture. It tells the story of who we are as a people, and helps to preserve our identity and our sense of belonging. Without our heritage, we would lose touch with our past, and our future generations would not have a sense of their roots.

Secondly, heritage sites and artifacts are often irreplaceable. Once they are destroyed or lost, they cannot be recovered. Many heritage sites and artifacts are also fragile and require careful preservation to prevent deterioration.

Thirdly, heritage tourism is a major industry in many parts of the world. Preserving our heritage not only benefits our cultural identity, but it can also bring economic benefits to local communities through tourism.

Finally, protecting our heritage is a moral obligation. We have a duty to safeguard our cultural heritage for future generations and to ensure that it is not lost or destroyed through neglect or willful destruction.

### Exercise 2: Read the article and circle the correct meanings of the highlighted words and phrases.

#### Article Text: PRESERVING OUR HERITAGE - Ideas from teenagers

To encourage young people to learn about and appreciate our cultural heritage, we organised an ideas competition. We invited students from across the country to send us their ideas for protecting and promoting our heritage. We have received many interesting entries. Below are the winners.

**A. _________________**

The idea of promoting heritage sites through social media came from a group of 11th grade students. They suggested using social media activities, such as photo competitions, to encourage young people to learn about our heritage sites and local traditions on important festivals. They also suggested creating trending topics or challenges on social media. For example, a postcard challenge will invite people to create and share unusual and exciting postcards about the heritage sites that they have visited.

**B. _________________**

Two 10th grade students suggested forming historical societies or local groups who have a keen interest in their history and heritage. These groups will provide information about local heritage sites, organise special events to celebrate local festivals, and invite young people to discuss issues related to preserving the heritage. This way, they will be able to give voice to suggestions and solutions to problems they care about. They will feel that their voices are heard, and they can contribute to society.

**C. _________________**

To preserve heritage, such as traditional music and stories, a group of secondary school students proposed setting up folk clubs. The clubs will hold events for young people to experience and learn about traditional performing arts. The artists will not only perform, but also introduce their arts and talk about how students can help promote folk culture. The clubs will organise training for students who want to learn folk songs, a traditional musical instrument, or folk dancing.

**Question:** Which of the ideas in the text do you like most? How will it help preserve heritage?

#### Suggested Answer (Lời giải chi tiết):

All of the ideas mentioned in the text are valuable and can help preserve heritage in their ways.

However, I think the idea of setting up folk clubs, as mentioned in Paragraph C, is particularly interesting. These clubs can provide opportunities for young people to learn about traditional performing arts, such as folk songs, musical instruments, and dancing. By organizing events, inviting artists to perform, and offering training to learn folk arts, the clubs can help promote and develop these traditional arts and keep them alive for future generations. Through these activities, young people can learn to appreciate their cultural heritage and become actively involved in preserving it.
