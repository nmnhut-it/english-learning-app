### Culture - UK Education After Secondary School

#### Reading: UK Education After Secondary School

**Text:**
In the UK, students can choose to end their formal education at 16, but in England they must stay in full-time education or do a training course until the age of 18.

Many 16-year-old students go on to study at different vocational colleges. Vocational education usually lasts up to three years. During this time, students learn job-specific skills. That is why vocational education is often referred to as career education or technical education. Many students still go on to higher education after receiving their vocational qualifications.

Alternatively, students can go to a sixth-form college or stay at their secondary school if it offers a sixth form for two more years. Students usually focus on three or four subjects that they are interested in or related to the degree they want to study at university. Exams are taken at the end of the two-year course, and the grades are used to apply for university courses. Not all students leaving sixth form go to university. Some prefer to get into a vocational course or find a job.

At university, students study for at least three years in order to get a bachelor's degree. After the first degree, they can study for one to two years to get a master's degree, and three to five years to get a doctorate.

#### Exercise 2: Group Discussion

**Topic:** Discuss the similarities and differences between education after leaving school in Viet Nam and in the UK.

**Sample Answer:**

**Similarities:**
- Both countries offer vocational education as an alternative to traditional academic education after secondary school.
- In both countries, students can continue their education after secondary school to obtain a bachelor's degree, master's degree, or a doctorate.
- In both countries, grades are important for further education, with students needing to achieve good grades to progress to higher levels of education.

**Differences:**
- In Vietnam, there is a strong emphasis on academic education, with vocational education being seen as a secondary option. In contrast, vocational education is given more importance in the UK and is often referred to as career education or technical education.
- In the UK, students have the option of attending sixth-form colleges or staying at their secondary schools for two more years to study subjects they are interested in or subjects related to higher education. Such an option is not available in Vietnam.
- The education system in Vietnam is heavily influenced by the government and is more centralized, while the UK education system is more decentralized and allows for greater autonomy in decision-making by schools and teachers.
- The length of time spent in university in Vietnam is longer compared to the UK. In Vietnam, a bachelor's degree can take up to five years to complete, while in the UK, it takes three years.
