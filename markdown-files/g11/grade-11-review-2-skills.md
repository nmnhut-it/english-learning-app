# Grade 11 - Review 2 - Skills

## I. Listening

### Exercise 1: Listen to a conversation between Nick and Ann. What are they talking about?

**Options:**
A. The effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate
B. Ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  
C. Ways to build green plants

### Audio Transcript
```
Nick: This year the winter is not as cold as usual.
Ann: Yep, our planet is getting warmer because of the increasing amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
Nick: I read in an article that cows release a large amount of methane in the atmosphere.
Ann: You're right. That's why some companies have applied a new technology to collect methane emissions from cows and turn them into usable energy.
Nick: It'd be good if methane is put to good use since there is more of it. As the world population is increasing, more beef and dairy products will be needed. As a result, more methane will be released.
Ann: Scientists are also looking for a way to make the oceans greener because they think plants could help take in more CO₂ and produce more oxygen.
Nick: Interesting! I heard about this. Yesterday, I watched a programme about a new project called NZT. It aims to collect CO₂ from industrial areas and transport it to storage sites beneath the North Sea.
Ann: That's amazing! I really hope these technologies can help reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.
```

#### Answer Key:
**B** - Ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

### Exercise 2: Listen again. Decide whether the following statements are true (T) or false (F).

| Statement | T | F |
|-----------|---|---|
| 1. Our planet is not as warm as usual. | | |
| 2. Methane emissions from cows can be changed into usable energy. | | |
| 3. Methane emissions will increase as a result of population growth. | | |
| 4. Scientists think that green oceans can't reduce the amount of CO2. | | |
| 5. The NZT project involves the transport and storage of CO2. | | |

#### Answer Key:
1. **F** - Our planet is not as warm as usual.
   - *Explanation:* Nick says "This year the winter is not as cold as usual" and Ann confirms "our planet is getting warmer"
2. **T** - Methane emissions from cows can be changed into usable energy.
   - *Explanation:* Ann states that companies have applied new technology to "collect methane emissions from cows and turn them into usable energy"
3. **T** - Methane emissions will increase as a result of population growth.
   - *Explanation:* Nick explains that as population increases, more beef and dairy products will be needed, resulting in more methane release
4. **F** - Scientists think that green oceans can't reduce the amount of CO2.
   - *Explanation:* Ann says scientists think plants could help take in more CO₂
5. **T** - The NZT project involves the transport and storage of CO2.
   - *Explanation:* Nick mentions the project aims to collect CO₂ from industrial areas and transport it to storage sites

## II. Speaking

### Discussion Task
Work in groups. Discuss if the following technologies mentioned in the Listening can be used in Viet Nam. Think about how they can help slow global warming.

**Technologies to discuss:**
- Turning methane emissions from cows into energy
- Growing plants in the ocean
- Keeping CO2 in storage sites

## III. Reading

### Exercise 1: Read the text and choose the best title for it.

**Text:**
ASEAN Youth Forum (AYF) is a programme for young people in ASEAN, which allows them to express their opinions and fight for their right to live in a sustainable and caring regional community. Its members regularly hold meetings and workshops to discuss the problems facing young people in ASEAN and how to address them. AYF also organises Youth: Open Space- an online space for young Southeast Asians to meet, connect, share and talk about current issues such as climate change, health, education, technology and online security. Over the past decade, AYF has had meetings in all ASEAN countries. It has connected thousands of young leaders from Southeast Asia, who meet to discuss and suggest strategies for making ASEAN a better community. These conferences aim to improve young people's leadership skills and strengthen regional unity.

**Options:**
A. Youth activities in ASEAN
B. A forum for ASEAN Youth
C. ASEAN and its forum

#### Answer Key:
**B** - A forum for ASEAN Youth

### Exercise 2: Read the text again and answer each question below with no more than THREE words.

1. In what kind of community do young people in ASEAN want to live?
2. What do AYF members regularly have?
3. What's the name of their online platform?
4. In which countries has AYF had meetings?
5. What do the AYF conferences aim to strengthen?

#### Answer Key:
1. **Sustainable and caring**
   - *Explanation:* The text states they fight for their right to live in a "sustainable and caring regional community"
2. **Meetings and workshops**
   - *Explanation:* "Its members regularly hold meetings and workshops"
3. **Youth: Open Space**
   - *Explanation:* "AYF also organises Youth: Open Space"
4. **All ASEAN countries**
   - *Explanation:* "AYF has had meetings in all ASEAN countries"
5. **Regional unity**
   - *Explanation:* "These conferences aim to...strengthen regional unity"

## IV. Writing

### Task: Write a proposal (120-150 words) to Youth: Open Space for a youth event to slow climate change in ASEAN countries. Use the following notes and outline to help you.

**Given Notes:**
- **Title:** ASEAN GREEN WEEK
- **Place:** In ASEAN countries
- **Time:** The first week of August/every year
- **Duration:** One week
- **Participants:** Young people in all ASEAN countries
- **Activities:**
  - cycling or going to school or work by public transport
  - planting trees
  - organising clean-up events in the community
- **Goals:**
  - to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide
  - to raise young people's awareness of environmental protection
- **Benefits:**
  - healthier lifestyles
  - a cleaner environment

### Model Answer:

**Title: ASEAN GREEN WEEK**

**To:** Youth: Open Space  
**Time:** The first week of August/every year  
**Prepared by:** Young people in all ASEAN countries

**Introduction:** Climate change is a serious problem in ASEAN because it is one of the regions most affected by it. We'd like to organise an ASEAN Green Week to help slow climate change in ASEAN countries.

**Details about the event:** We would like to propose a youth event called "ASEAN GREEN WEEK" to raise awareness about environmental protection and reduce carbon dioxide in ASEAN countries. This event will take place during the first week of August every year and involve young people from all ASEAN countries.

During the week, we will encourage participants to adopt sustainable lifestyle practices, such as cycling or taking public transport to school or work. We will also organize tree-planting activities and clean-up events in communities across the region.

**Goals and benefits:** The goals of ASEAN GREEN WEEK are to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and raise young people's awareness of environmental protection. By promoting sustainable practices and encouraging people to take action, we hope to create a cleaner and healthier environment.

**Conclusion:** We really hope you will consider our proposal as we think that climate change is a pressing issue in ASEAN that needs to be solved as soon as possible.
