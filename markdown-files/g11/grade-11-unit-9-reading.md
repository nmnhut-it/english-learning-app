## Peer pressure (Áp lực đồng trang lứa)

### Exercise 1: Work in pairs. Discuss the question.

**Question:** Have your friends ever made you do something you do not like? If yes, give an example.
(Bạn của bạn đã từng khiến bạn làm điều gì bạn không thích chưa? Nếu có, hãy cho ví dụ.)

#### Suggested Answers:

1. I have a lot of comics and my friends often borrow them from me. I'm fine with that. However, there is one friend who borrowed comics from me, but whenever she returned them, my comics are terrible! They were torn, dirty and there were even some drawings on one of them! To be honest, I don't like lending her my books, but I don't want her to tell anything bad about me to other friends. That's the reason why I still keep lending her my comics.

2. I don't like to get piercings, but some of friends in my group got piercings on their ears and nose. Although I find it too rebellious for me to follow, I still got some piercings on my ears because my group call them "friendship piercings". But I only felt hurt when getting them...

### Article: Teen's life - I don't want to be the odd one out!

**Student Testimonials:**

> "My parents don't want me to hang out with my friends from school. They think those friends have a bad influence on me. They aren't happy that instead of going home after school, we go to games centres to play video games. But I think it's fun, and I don't want to lose my friends," Thanh, 17.

> "One day I coloured my hair and painted my finger nails. My parents got so angry with me. I know that this is not allowed at school, but all the girls in my group of friends did the same. I don't want to be the odd one out!" Van, 16.

**[A]** The emails we have received from teenagers this week point to the effects of peer pressure, which is when you do things because you want to be accepted or valued by your friends. If teens fail to do what their group of friends want them to do, they may not be accepted or may even be bullied.

**[B]** In many cases, peer pressure can lead to depression, low self-confidence, distance from family and poor school performance. It can also lead to bigger social issues. It was reported that 70% of teenage smokers surveyed in the US said that they started smoking because they had friends who were smoking.

**[C]** It is not always easy to stand up to peer pressure, but sooner or later you need to decide what is best for you. Choose the right friends, learn to say no when you don't feel comfortable and don't hesitate to talk to an adult when the situation looks dangerous. And remember it's sometimes OK to be "the odd one out".

#### Sample Answer:

Khoa is a 16-year-old high school student who loves spending time with his group of friends after school. They usually go to the mall, play sports or video games, or just hang out at each other's houses. However, Khoa's parents are becoming increasingly concerned about his friends' behavior and influence on him. They've noticed that Khoa is staying out later than usual, neglecting his school work, and acting more rebellious and disrespectful at home.

Khoa's parents have tried to talk to him about their concerns and suggest that he spend less time with his friends or choose better friends, but Khoa resists their efforts. He argues that his friends are cool and fun to be with, and that his parents are just being overprotective and boring.

The situation becomes more tense when Khoa's parents find out that some of his friends have been caught smoking and shoplifting. They forbid Khoa from hanging out with them and threaten to punish him if he disobeys. Khoa feels torn between his loyalty to his friends and his respect for his parents' authority.

In this scenario, Khoa and his parents are facing a common problem of conflicting values and priorities. Khoa wants to belong to his peer group and have fun, while his parents want to protect him from negative influences and ensure his future success. It's not easy for either side to compromise or understand each other's perspective, but communication and empathy can help bridge the gap.
