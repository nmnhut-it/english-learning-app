#### Audio Transcript
```
More and more school-leavers are choosing to study abroad after finishing secondary school. While this is definitely an exciting experience, it's living independently in a foreign country that is challenging for many students. In today's talk, I'll share some tips with you to help you become more independent when studying abroad.

First of all, you should learn a foreign language well. This way, you will become more independent while attending the lectures at the university and studying for the exams afterwards. A good knowledge of the local language will also help you take part in conversations with local people, thus making you more confident in your daily life.

Another way to become more independent is to get a part-time job, which will allow you to earn some pocket money. You will also learn how to be more organised and feel more independent by gaining some work experience. The best thing is that you will be regularly paid, cover some of your expenses and even save some money.

Cooking for yourself is also a good way to become more independent. When you're living abroad, you must learn to cook if you don't want to eat junk food or spend a lot of money at restaurants. Knowing how to cook and knowing what ingredients you put in your meals will give you a sense of freedom and independence.

**DON CA TAI TU: THE VOICE OF THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE**

Recognised as UNESCO's world cultural heritage in 2013, don ca tai tu has been an important part of people's life and work in the Mekong River Delta region.

**A. _________________**

Having appeared in the late 19th century, don ca tai tu became a popular art form in southern Viet Nam. It started as daily entertainment for the village farmers, who were good neighbours and close friends. After working hard in the fields, the neighbours usually gathered together to sing and relax. This was the time when people started performing this kind of music.

**B. _________________**

Typically, the men in the group play the instruments while the women sing. Most of the musicians and singers are not professionally trained; they are just music lovers performing with all their heart. They usually perform at events such as weddings and traditional festivals, and the melodies express different moods and feelings.

**C. _________________**

Today, tourists can enjoy don ca tai tu performances in southern Viet Nam, where local artists perform at floating markets or in fruit gardens. Such performances help preserve the art form and allow artists to reach a wider audience, including people from around the world.
