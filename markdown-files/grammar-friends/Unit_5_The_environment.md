## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Will và Won't - Dự đoán về tương lai

**Công dụng:** Dùng để nói về tương lai, đặc biệt là để đưa ra dự đoán về những điều chúng ta nghĩ sẽ xảy ra.

**Cấu trúc:**

**A. Khẳng định:**
- S + **will** + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ: 
  - The streets **will be** cleaner. (Đường phố sẽ sạch hơn.)
  - The earth **will be** a better place. (Trái đất sẽ là một nơi tốt hơn.)

**B. Phủ định:**
- S + **won't** (will not) + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ:
  - We **won't drive** big cars. (Chúng ta sẽ không lái những chiếc xe to.)
  - We **won't use** so much energy. (Chúng ta sẽ không dùng nhiều năng lượng như vậy.)

**C. Nghi vấn:**
- **Will** + S + V (nguyên mẫu)?
- Trả lời ngắn: Yes, S + **will**. / No, S + **won't**.
- Ví dụ:
  - **Will** we do anything differently? (Chúng ta có làm gì khác đi không?)
  - → Yes, we **will**. / No, we **won't**.

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Sau "will" và "won't" luôn là động từ nguyên mẫu (không chia)
- Dạng viết tắt thường dùng: 'll (will), won't (will not)
- Ví dụ: We**'ll** recycle more. (Chúng ta sẽ tái chế nhiều hơn.)

### 2. Thì Hiện tại tiếp diễn với nghĩa tương lai (Present Continuous with Future Meaning)

**Công dụng:** Dùng để nói về những điều chúng ta đã sắp xếp, lên kế hoạch để làm trong tương lai. Thường dùng cho các kế hoạch cá nhân.

**Cấu trúc:**

**A. Khẳng định:**
- S + am/is/are + V-ing
- Ví dụ:
  - We**'re going** on a walking holiday. (Chúng tôi sẽ đi nghỉ bằng cách đi bộ.)
  - We**'re riding** our bikes from home to our uncle's house. (Chúng tôi sẽ đạp xe từ nhà đến nhà chú.)

**B. Phủ định:**
- S + am/is/are + not + V-ing
- Ví dụ:
  - We **aren't flying**. (Chúng tôi sẽ không đi máy bay.)
  - We **aren't driving** by car. (Chúng tôi sẽ không lái xe.)

**C. Nghi vấn:**
- Am/Is/Are + S + V-ing?
- Ví dụ:
  - **Are** you **travelling** by train? (Bạn có đi tàu không?)
  - What **are** you **doing** next week? (Bạn sẽ làm gì vào tuần tới?)

**Dấu hiệu nhận biết:**
- Thường có các từ chỉ thời gian: next week, tomorrow, tonight, this weekend
- Nói về những kế hoạch đã được sắp xếp trước

**Ví dụ:**
- We**'re going** on our holiday next week. (Chúng tôi sẽ đi nghỉ vào tuần tới.)
- I **am travelling** to Germany by train. (Tôi sẽ đi Đức bằng tàu.)

### 3. Phân biệt Will và Present Continuous (Future Meaning)

**WILL:**
- Dùng cho dự đoán, ý kiến về tương lai
- Quyết định tức thời
- Những điều chưa chắc chắn sẽ xảy ra
- Ví dụ: The streets **will be** cleaner. (Dự đoán)

**PRESENT CONTINUOUS:**
- Dùng cho kế hoạch đã sắp xếp
- Những việc đã chuẩn bị, đã định trước
- Thường là kế hoạch cá nhân
- Ví dụ: We**'re going** on holiday next week. (Kế hoạch đã sắp xếp)

**So sánh:**
- I think it **will rain** tomorrow. (Dự đoán - chưa chắc chắn)
- I**'m meeting** my friend tomorrow at 5pm. (Kế hoạch đã hẹn - chắc chắn)
