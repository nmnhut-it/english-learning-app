## Modals for possibility: may, might and could / Have to

---

## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Động từ khiếm khuyết diễn tả khả năng (Modals for Possibility)

**May, might và could** là các động từ khiếm khuyết (modal verbs). Chúng ta sử dụng chúng để nói về những điều có thể xảy ra bây giờ hoặc trong tương lai.

**Công dụng:** Diễn tả khả năng, sự có thể xảy ra của một sự việc (không chắc chắn 100%)

**Ví dụ:**
- He **might** win! (Anh ấy có thể thắng!)
- He **could** become a famous sportsman. (Anh ấy có thể trở thành một vận động viên nổi tiếng.)
- I **may** study art at a special art school. (Tôi có thể học nghệ thuật ở trường nghệ thuật đặc biệt.)

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
Không có sự khác biệt quan trọng giữa ba động từ này khi diễn tả khả năng:
- It **may** rain. = It **might** rain. = It **could** rain. (Trời có thể mưa.)

---

### 2. Cấu trúc của May, Might và Could

**A. Khẳng định:**
```
S + may/might/could + V (nguyên mẫu)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- It **might** rain. (Trời có thể mưa.)
- He **may** win the competition. (Anh ấy có thể thắng cuộc thi.)
- She **could** be at home. (Cô ấy có thể ở nhà.)

**B. Phủ định:**
```
S + may/might/could + not + V (nguyên mẫu)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- It **might not** rain. (Trời có thể không mưa.)
- He **may not** be a good player. (Anh ấy có thể không phải là một cầu thủ giỏi.)
- I **might not** win it this year. (Tôi có thể không thắng nó năm nay.)

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Chúng ta KHÔNG thêm 's' vào ngôi thứ ba số ít
- ✓ He **might** win. 
- ✗ He **mights** win.

- Sau may/might/could luôn là động từ nguyên mẫu (không chia)
- ✓ She **may** go.
- ✗ She **may** goes.

---

### 3. Sử dụng May, Might, Could với First Conditional

Chúng ta cũng có thể sử dụng **may, might và could** trong câu điều kiện loại 1 để nói về những điều có thể xảy ra trong tương lai. Nếu hành động đầu tiên xảy ra, hành động thứ hai **có khả năng** xảy ra (không chắc chắn).

**Cấu trúc:**
```
If + S + V (present simple), S + may/might/could + V (base form)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- If you do lots of running, you **could** win the race. (Nếu bạn chạy nhiều, bạn có thể thắng cuộc đua.)
- If I have more time to practice, I **could** be better at art. (Nếu tôi có nhiều thời gian tập luyện hơn, tôi có thể giỏi hơn về nghệ thuật.)

**So sánh với Will:**
- **Will/Won't:** Nói về điều chắc chắn sẽ xảy ra
  - If you do lots of running, you **will be** very healthy. (Chắc chắn sẽ khỏe mạnh)

- **May/Might/Could:** Nói về điều có khả năng xảy ra (không chắc chắn)
  - If you do lots of running, you **could win** the race. (Có khả năng thắng - không chắc)

### 4. Have to - Diễn tả sự cần thiết/bắt buộc

**Công dụng:** Chúng ta sử dụng **have to + base form** để nói về điều gì đó mà một người phải làm (có nghĩa vụ, bắt buộc).

**Cấu trúc:**

**A. Khẳng định:**
```
S + have/has to + V (nguyên mẫu)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- We **have to** eat healthy food. (Chúng ta phải ăn đồ ăn lành mạnh.)
- I **had to** practise every day. (Tôi phải tập luyện mỗi ngày.)
- Footballers **have to** be very strong. (Cầu thủ bóng đá phải rất khỏe.)

**B. Phủ định (không cần thiết):**
```
S + don't/doesn't/didn't + have to + V (nguyên mẫu)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- I **don't have to** play every day. (Tôi không cần phải chơi mỗi ngày.)
- I **didn't have to** eat special food when I was younger. (Tôi không cần phải ăn đồ ăn đặc biệt khi tôi còn nhỏ.)

**C. Nghi vấn:**
```
Do/Does/Did + S + have to + V (nguyên mẫu)?
```

**Trả lời ngắn:** 
- Yes, + S + do/does/did.
- No, + S + don't/doesn't/didn't.

**Ví dụ:**
- **Do** you **have to** eat special food? → Yes, we **do**. / No, we **don't**.
- **Did** you **have to** work hard to get there? → Yes, I **did**. / No, I **didn't**.

---

### 5. Các dạng thì của Have to

**Present (Hiện tại):**
- I/You/We/They **have to** study.
- He/She/It **has to** study.

**Past (Quá khứ):**
- I/You/He/She/It/We/They **had to** study.

**Phủ định Hiện tại:**
- I/You/We/They **don't have to** study.
- He/She/It **doesn't have to** study.

**Phủ định Quá khứ:**
- I/You/He/She/It/We/They **didn't have to** study.

---

### 6. Phân biệt Have to và Must

**HAVE TO:**
- Nghĩa vụ từ bên ngoài (luật lệ, quy định, người khác bắt buộc)
- Có các dạng thì khác nhau (have to, had to, will have to)
- Ví dụ: Students **have to** wear uniforms. (Quy định của trường)

**MUST:**
- Nghĩa vụ từ người nói (ý kiến cá nhân, cảm giác cần thiết)
- Chỉ có một dạng (must)
- Ví dụ: I **must** study harder. (Tôi cảm thấy cần phải học chăm hơn)

**Phủ định:**
- **don't have to** = không cần thiết (không bắt buộc)
- **must not** = cấm (không được phép)
