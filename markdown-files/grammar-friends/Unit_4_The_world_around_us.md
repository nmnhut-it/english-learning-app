# Unit 4: The world around us
## The Past Continuous and the Past Simple / Used to

---

## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Thì Quá khứ tiếp diễn (Past Continuous)

**Công dụng:** Diễn tả một hành động đang xảy ra tại một thời điểm cụ thể trong quá khứ, hoặc một hành động dài hơn đang diễn ra thì có hành động ngắn khác xen vào.

**Cấu trúc:**
- **Khẳng định:** S + was/were + V-ing
  - I/He/She/It + **was** + V-ing
  - We/You/They + **were** + V-ing
  
- **Phủ định:** S + was/were + not + V-ing
  
- **Nghi vấn:** Was/Were + S + V-ing?

**Ví dụ:**
- We **were walking** home when we saw a bag of rubbish. (Chúng tôi đang đi bộ về nhà thì thấy một túi rác.)
- I **was cycling** home when I saw a new house. (Tôi đang đạp xe về nhà thì thấy một ngôi nhà mới.)

---

### 2. Thì Quá khứ đơn (Past Simple)

**Công dụng:** Diễn tả một hành động đã hoàn thành trong quá khứ, thường là hành động ngắn xảy ra trong khi hành động dài đang diễn ra.

**Cấu trúc:**
- **Khẳng định:** S + V2/V-ed
- **Phủ định:** S + didn't + V (nguyên mẫu)
- **Nghi vấn:** Did + S + V (nguyên mẫu)?

**Ví dụ:**
- We were walking home when we **saw** a bag of rubbish. (Chúng tôi đang đi bộ về nhà thì **thấy** một túi rác.)
- Mr Smith was driving home when the storm **started**. (Ông Smith đang lái xe về nhà thì cơn bão **bắt đầu**.)

---

### 3. Kết hợp Past Continuous và Past Simple với WHEN

**Khi dùng chung trong một câu:**

Chúng ta thường sử dụng **Past Continuous** với **Past Simple** khi kết hợp hai hành động bằng từ **when**:
- Hành động dài (đang diễn ra) → **Past Continuous**
- Hành động ngắn (xen vào) → **Past Simple**

**Cấu trúc:**
- S + **was/were V-ing** + when + S + **V2/V-ed**
- When + S + **V2/V-ed**, S + **was/were V-ing**

**Ví dụ:**
- I **was cycling** home when I **saw** a new house. (Tôi đang đạp xe về nhà thì thấy một ngôi nhà mới.)
- When the phone **rang**, what **were you doing**? (Khi điện thoại reo, bạn đang làm gì?)

**Tạo câu hỏi:**
- **Were you walking** home when you saw a bag of rubbish? → Yes, we were.
- When you were walking home, **did you see** a bag of rubbish? → Yes, we did.

---

### 4. Used to (Đã từng)

**Công dụng:** Diễn tả các tình huống hoặc thói quen trong quá khứ mà hiện tại không còn nữa.

**Cấu trúc:**

**A. Khẳng định:**
- S + **used to** + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ: 
  - We **used to spend** a lot of money. (Chúng tôi đã từng tiêu nhiều tiền.)
  - The energy bills **used to be** expensive. (Hóa đơn điện đã từng rất đắt.)

**B. Phủ định:**
- S + **didn't use to** + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ:
  - The old owner **didn't use to** look after the garden. (Chủ cũ không từng chăm sóc khu vườn.)
  - Mum **didn't use to** go to a drama club. (Mẹ không từng đi câu lạc bộ kịch.)

**C. Nghi vấn:**
- **Did** + S + **use to** + V (nguyên mẫu)?
- Trả lời ngắn: Yes, S + did. / No, S + didn't.
- Ví dụ:
  - **Did they use to** use a lot of energy? → Yes, they did. / No, they didn't.
  - **Did you use to** like school? → Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- "Used to" chỉ dùng cho quá khứ, không dùng cho hiện tại
- Hành động/thói quen đã kết thúc, không còn làm nữa
- Khác với "be used to" (quen với) và "get used to" (làm quen với)

**So sánh:**
- I **used to** play football. (Tôi đã từng chơi bóng đá - nhưng bây giờ không còn chơi nữa)
- I **didn't use to** like vegetables. (Tôi đã từng không thích rau - nhưng bây giờ thích rồi)
