## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Câu bị động thì Quá khứ đơn (Past Simple Passive)

**Công dụng:** Chúng ta sử dụng câu bị động thì quá khứ đơn để nói về những hành động đã hoàn thành trong quá khứ khi chúng ta không biết hoặc không quan trọng ai đã làm hành động đó.

**Cấu trúc:**
```
S + was/were (not) + past participle (V3)
```

**Khẳng định:**
- The first aeroplane **was flown** by Orville and Wilbur Wright. (Chiếc máy bay đầu tiên được bay bởi Orville và Wilbur Wright.)
- Television **was invented** in 1927 by John Logie Baird. (Truyền hình được phát minh năm 1927 bởi John Logie Baird.)
- The first car **was made** by Karl Benz in Germany. (Chiếc xe hơi đầu tiên được làm bởi Karl Benz ở Đức.)
- The first telephone call **was made** by Alexander Graham Bell on 10th March 1876. (Cuộc gọi điện thoại đầu tiên được thực hiện bởi Alexander Graham Bell vào ngày 10 tháng 3 năm 1876.)

**Phủ định:**
- The first aeroplane **wasn't invented** by John Logie Baird. (Chiếc máy bay đầu tiên không được phát minh bởi John Logie Baird.)
- The telephone **wasn't made** in the 20th century. (Điện thoại không được làm trong thế kỷ 20.)

### 4. Phân biệt Active và Passive (Past Simple)

**Active (Chủ động):**
- Orville and Wilbur Wright **flew** the first aeroplane.
- John Logie Baird **invented** television in 1927.

- The first aeroplane **was flown** by Orville and Wilbur Wright.
- Television **was invented** in 1927 by John Logie Baird.
- The first car **was made** by Karl Benz in Germany.

**Khi nào dùng Passive:**
- Nhấn mạnh đối tượng (invention) hơn là người làm
- Người làm không quan trọng hoặc không biết
- Khi nói về phát minh, khám phá lịch sử

---

### 5. Câu hỏi bị động (Passive Questions)

**Cấu trúc cơ bản:**
```
Was/Were + S + past participle?
```

**Ví dụ:**
- **Are** monkeys **found** in England? (Khỉ có được tìm thấy ở Anh không?)
- **Was** the first plane **invented** by the Wright Brothers? (Máy bay đầu tiên có được phát minh bởi anh em nhà Wright không?)
- **Were** films **made** in the United Kingdom? (Phim có được làm ở Vương quốc Anh không?)

**Trả lời ngắn:**
- Yes, it **was**. / No, it **wasn't**.
- Yes, they **were**. / No, they **weren't**.

---

### 6. Câu hỏi với WHO, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT

**A. Câu hỏi với WHO (ai):**
- Hỏi về người thực hiện hành động
- Đặt **by** ở cuối câu

**Cấu trúc:**
```
Who + was/were + S + past participle + by?
```

**Ví dụ:**
- **Who** was the first plane invented **by**? (Máy bay đầu tiên được phát minh bởi ai?)
- **Who** was the film directed **by**? (Bộ phim được đạo diễn bởi ai?)

---

**B. Câu hỏi với WHEN (khi nào):**
- Hỏi về thời gian
- Thứ tự từ không đổi

**Cấu trúc:**
```
When + was/were + S + past participle?
```

**Ví dụ:**
- **When** was television invented? (Truyền hình được phát minh khi nào?)
- **When** was the first car made? (Chiếc xe hơi đầu tiên được làm khi nào?)

---

**C. Câu hỏi với WHERE (ở đâu):**
- Hỏi về địa điểm
- Thứ tự từ không đổi

**Cấu trúc:**
```
Where + was/were + S + past participle?
```

**Ví dụ:**

- **Where** was the film directed **by**? (Bộ phim được đạo diễn ở đâu?)

---

**D. Câu hỏi với WHAT (cái gì):**
- Hỏi về vật/sự việc
- Nếu dùng **what**, chúng ta tạo câu hỏi bị động như sau:

**Cấu trúc:**
```
What + was/were + past participle + (on/in...)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- **What** was invented on 10th March 1876? (Cái gì được phát minh vào ngày 10 tháng 3 năm 1876?)

---

### 7. Lưu ý quan trọng

**1. By và With trong câu hỏi:**
- **BY** + người thực hiện

  - What was the picture painted **with**?

**2. Thứ tự từ trong câu hỏi:**
- Với WHO, WHEN, WHERE: thứ tự từ không đổi
- Luôn có was/were sau từ để hỏi

**3. Phân biệt Active và Passive Questions:**
