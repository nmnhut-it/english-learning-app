## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Câu tường thuật (Reported Speech) - Khái niệm cơ bản

**Công dụng:** Đôi khi chúng ta muốn kể lại những gì một người khác đã nói. Điều này được gọi là câu tường thuật (reported speech). Chúng ta có thể tường thuật lại lời nói của người khác hoặc lời nói của chính mình.

**Sự khác biệt:**

**Direct Speech (Lời nói trực tiếp):**
- Trích dẫn chính xác lời nói của ai đó
- Sử dụng dấu ngoặc kép ""
- Ví dụ: "It's broken." (Nó bị vỡ.)
- Ví dụ: "I'm not staying at home." (Tôi không ở nhà.)

**Reported Speech (Lời nói gián tiếp):**
- Kể lại những gì ai đó nói, không dùng dấu ngoặc kép
- Thay đổi thì của động từ (thường lùi một thì)
- Thay đổi đại từ
- Ví dụ: The doctor said it was broken. (Bác sĩ nói rằng nó bị vỡ.)
- Ví dụ: Tommy said he wasn't staying at home. (Tommy nói rằng cậu ấy không ở nhà.)

---

### 2. Thay đổi thì động từ trong Reported Speech

**Quy tắc chung:** Khi chuyển từ lời nói trực tiếp sang gián tiếp, động từ thường lùi một thì về quá khứ.

**Bảng chuyển đổi thì:**

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Present Simple** → | **Past Simple** |
| "It's broken." | He said it **was** broken. |
| "I'm not staying at home." | He said he **wasn't** staying at home. |
| **Present Continuous** → | **Past Continuous** |
| "I'm working." | She said she **was working**. |
| "We're studying." | They said they **were studying**. |
| **Past Simple** → | **Past Perfect** (có thể giữ nguyên) |
| "I went home." | He said he **had gone** home. |
| **will** → | **would** |
| "I will help you." | She said she **would** help me. |
| **can** → | **could** |
| "I can swim." | He said he **could** swim. |
| **have to** → | **had to** |
| "You have to go to school." | Dad told me I **had to** go to school. |

### 3. Said và Told - Phân biệt cách dùng

**SAID:**
- Dùng khi KHÔNG nói rõ người được nói chuyện
- Cấu trúc: S + **said** + (that) + clause
- Ví dụ: 
  - The doctor **said** it was broken. (Bác sĩ nói nó bị vỡ.)
  - Fiona **said** she was resting in hospital. (Fiona nói cô ấy đang nghỉ ngơi ở bệnh viện.)

**TOLD:**
- Dùng khi CÓ nói rõ người được nói chuyện
- Cấu trúc: S + **told** + object pronoun (me/you/him/her/us/them) + (that) + clause
- Ví dụ:
  - Dad **told me** I had to go to school. (Bố bảo tôi phải đi học.)
  - Fiona **told me** she was resting in hospital. (Fiona nói với tôi rằng cô ấy đang nghỉ ngơi ở bệnh viện.)
  - Fiona **told Steven Ross** she was resting in hospital. (Fiona nói với Steven Ross rằng cô ấy đang nghỉ ngơi.)

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Đại từ tân ngữ (object pronouns): me, you, him, her, it, us, you, them
- KHÔNG nói: "He said me..." ❌ → Phải nói: "He told me..." ✓
- KHÔNG nói: "He told..." (thiếu tân ngữ) ❌ → Phải nói: "He said..." hoặc "He told me..." ✓

### 4. Thay đổi đại từ trong Reported Speech

Khi chuyển sang câu tường thuật, chúng ta cần thay đổi đại từ để phù hợp với người nói mới.

**Ví dụ:**
- Direct: "**I'm** not staying at home." (Tommy nói)
- Reported: Tommy said **he** wasn't staying at home.

- Direct: "**You** have to go to school." (Dad nói với Tommy)
- Reported: Dad told me **I** had to go to school.

**Bảng chuyển đổi đại từ:**

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
|---------------|-----------------|
| I | he/she |
| we | they |
| you | I/we/he/she/they (tùy ngữ cảnh) |
| my | his/her |
| our | their |
| your | my/our/his/her/their |

---

### 5. Thay đổi từ chỉ thời gian trong Reported Speech

Khi tường thuật lại lời nói, các từ chỉ thời gian cũng thay đổi để phản ánh đúng thời điểm.

**Bảng chuyển đổi từ chỉ thời gian:**

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **tonight** | **that night** |
| **today** | **that day** |
| **this week/month/year/evening** | **that week/month/year/evening** |
| **tomorrow** | **the next day** (ngày hôm sau) |
| **next week/month/year** | **the next week/month/year** |
| **now** | **then** |
| **yesterday** | **the day before** / **the previous day** |
| **last week/month/year** | **the week/month/year before** |
| **ago** | **before** |

**Ví dụ:**
- Direct: "I'm happy about going home **tomorrow**."
- Reported: Fiona said she was happy about going home **the next day**.

- Direct: "I saw him **today**."
- Reported: She said she had seen him **that day**.
