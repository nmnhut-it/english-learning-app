## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Be going to - Dùng cho kế hoạch và ý định

**Công dụng:** Dùng để nói về những kế hoạch hoặc ý định mà chúng ta đã quyết định trước. Chúng ta đã biết chúng ta sẽ làm gì.

**Cấu trúc:**

**A. Khẳng định:**
- S + **am/is/are going to** + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ:
  - I**'m going to** visit the elephant house. (Tôi sẽ thăm chuồng voi.)
  - I**'m going to** see the reptile house first. (Tôi sẽ xem nhà bò sát trước.)
  - They**'re going to** feed the snakes soon. (Họ sẽ cho rắn ăn sớm.)

**B. Phủ định:**
- S + **am/is/are not going to** + V (nguyên mẫu)
- Ví dụ:
  - I**'m not going to** visit the reptile house. (Tôi sẽ không thăm nhà bò sát.)
  - We**'re not going to** see the snakes. (Chúng tôi sẽ không xem rắn.)

**C. Nghi vấn:**
- **Am/Is/Are** + S + **going to** + V (nguyên mẫu)?
- Ví dụ:
  - What **are** you **going to** do first? (Bạn sẽ làm gì trước tiên?)
  - **Are** you **going to** visit the reptile house first? (Bạn có sẽ thăm nhà bò sát trước không?)

**Trả lời ngắn:**
- Yes, + S + **am/is/are**. (KHÔNG dùng dạng rút gọn)
- No, + S + **am not/isn't/aren't**.
- Ví dụ: Are you going to visit the reptile house? → Yes, **we are**. / No, **we aren't**.

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Trong câu khẳng định và phủ định, ta thường dùng dạng rút gọn: I'm, you're, he's, she's, we're, they're
- Trong câu trả lời ngắn khẳng định, KHÔNG dùng dạng rút gọn: Yes, we **are**. (KHÔNG nói: Yes, we're.)

### 2. Be going to - Dùng cho dự đoán dựa trên bằng chứng

**Công dụng:** Dùng để dự đoán tương lai dựa trên những gì chúng ta nhìn thấy hoặc biết HIỆN TẠI. Chúng ta thấy điều gì đó bây giờ và điều đó khiến chúng ta nghĩ một việc nào đó sẽ xảy ra trong tương lai.

**Cấu trúc:** Giống như phần 1
- S + **am/is/are going to** + V (nguyên mẫu)

**So sánh Hiện tại và Tương lai:**

| Hiện tại (Now) | Tương lai (Future - Prediction) |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| The keeper is throwing fish to the dolphins. | The dolphins **are going to** eat the fish. |
| (Người giữ đang ném cá cho cá heo.) | (Cá heo **sẽ** ăn cá.) |
| The eagle's flying towards the fish. | The eagle**'s going to** catch the fish. |
| (Đại bàng đang bay về phía con cá.) | (Đại bàng **sẽ** bắt con cá.) |

**Ví dụ thêm:**
- There are black clouds in the sky. → It**'s going to** rain. (Có mây đen trên trời. → Trời sẽ mưa.)
- Dad looks tired. → He**'s going to** sit down. (Bố trông mệt. → Bố sẽ ngồi xuống.)
- They've got a football. → They**'re going to** play football. (Họ có một quả bóng. → Họ sẽ chơi bóng.)

---

### 3. Phân biệt Be going to và Will

**BE GOING TO:**
- Kế hoạch/ý định đã quyết định trước
- Dự đoán có bằng chứng (nhìn thấy điều gì đó)
- Ví dụ: I**'m going to** visit the zoo tomorrow. (Tôi đã quyết định rồi)
- Ví dụ: Look at those clouds! It**'s going to** rain. (Tôi thấy mây đen)

**WILL:**
- Dự đoán chung chung (ý kiến cá nhân)
- Quyết định tức thời (vừa mới nghĩ ra)
- Ví dụ: I think it **will** rain tomorrow. (Ý kiến - không có bằng chứng cụ thể)
- Ví dụ: I **will** help you. (Quyết định ngay lúc đó)

---

### 4. Phân biệt Be going to và Present Continuous (Future)

**BE GOING TO:**
- Ý định, kế hoạch chung chung
- Có thể chưa sắp xếp cụ thể
- Ví dụ: I**'m going to** study English. (Ý định - chưa rõ khi nào, ở đâu)

**PRESENT CONTINUOUS (Future):**
- Kế hoạch đã sắp xếp cụ thể
- Có thời gian, địa điểm rõ ràng
- Ví dụ: I**'m studying** English at 5pm today. (Đã sắp xếp cụ thể)
