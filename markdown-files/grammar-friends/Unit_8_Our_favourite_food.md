## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Câu điều kiện loại 1 (First Conditional) - Khái niệm

**Công dụng:** Chúng ta sử dụng câu điều kiện loại 1 để nói về những điều có thể xảy ra trong tương lai. Chúng ta dùng nó khi một hành động phụ thuộc vào một hành động khác.

**Ý nghĩa:** 
- Nói về tình huống có thật hoặc có thể xảy ra trong tương lai
- Một việc sẽ xảy ra NẾU một điều kiện nào đó được đáp ứng

**Ví dụ:**
- **If** we buy some biscuits, we**'ll have** something to take to his party. (Nếu chúng ta mua bánh quy, chúng ta sẽ có thứ gì đó để mang đến bữa tiệc của cậu ấy.)
- **If** we take a home-made fruit cake, we **won't have** to eat unhealthy food. (Nếu chúng ta mang bánh trái cây tự làm, chúng ta sẽ không phải ăn đồ ăn không lành mạnh.)

---

### 2. Cấu trúc câu điều kiện loại 1

Một câu điều kiện loại 1 có **HAI mệnh đề**:

**A. If-clause (Mệnh đề If):**
- Chứa điều kiện
- Dùng thì **Present Simple** (hiện tại đơn)
- Cấu trúc: **If + S + V (present simple), ...**

**B. Will/Won't-clause (Mệnh đề chính):**
- Chứa kết quả
- Dùng **will/won't + V (nguyên mẫu)**
- Cấu trúc: **... S + will/won't + V (base form)**

**Công thức tổng quát:**

```
If + S + V (present simple), S + will/won't + V (base form)
```

**Ví dụ:**

| If-clause | Will/Won't-clause |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **If** we buy some biscuits, | we**'ll have** something to take to his party. |
| **If** we take a home-made fruit cake, | we **won't have** to eat unhealthy food. |
| **If** you eat healthy food, | you **will be** strong and have lots of energy. |

---

### 3. Đảo vị trí các mệnh đề

**Chúng ta có thể đổi vị trí hai mệnh đề:**

**Cách 1: If-clause trước**
- **If** we go home now**,** we'll have time to make a cake.
- ➡️ Có dấu **phẩy (,)** giữa hai mệnh đề

**Cách 2: Will/Won't-clause trước**
- We'll have time to make a cake **if** we go home now.
- ➡️ KHÔNG có dấu phẩy

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Khi if-clause đứng trước → CÓ dấu phẩy
- Khi will-clause đứng trước → KHÔNG có dấu phẩy

---

### 4. Câu điều kiện loại 1 - Khẳng định

**Cấu trúc:**
```
If + S + V (present simple), S + will + V (base form)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- If you eat healthy food, you **will be** strong.
- If you eat well, you **won't get** ill very often.
- If you have lots of fruit and vegetables every day, you**'ll get** all the vitamins you need.

**Dạng rút gọn:**
- we will = **we'll**
- you will = **you'll**
- he will = **he'll**
- she will = **she'll**
- it will = **it'll**
- they will = **they'll**

---

### 5. Câu điều kiện loại 1 - Phủ định

**Cấu trúc:**
```
If + S + V (present simple), S + won't + V (base form)
```

**Ví dụ:**
- If we take a home-made fruit cake, we **won't have** to eat unhealthy food.
- If you eat well, you **won't get** ill very often.
- If you're tired, you **won't do** as well at school.

**Lưu ý:**
- won't = will not
- Sau won't luôn là động từ nguyên mẫu (không chia)

---

### 6. Câu điều kiện loại 1 - Câu hỏi

**Cách tạo câu hỏi:** Chuyển mệnh đề will/won't thành câu hỏi. Mệnh đề if-clause giữ nguyên.

**Cấu trúc:**
```
Will + S + V (base form) + if + S + V (present simple)?
```

**Hoặc:**
```
If + S + V (present simple), will + S + V (base form)?
```

**Ví dụ:**

| Will/Won't-clause (Question) | If-clause |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| **Will** you go to sleep | **if** you get tired? |
| **Will** you find what you need | **if** you go shopping in supermarkets? |

**Trả lời ngắn:**
- Yes, + S + **will**. (KHÔNG dùng dạng rút gọn)
- No, + S + **won't**.

**Ví dụ:**
- Will you go to sleep if you get tired? 
  - → Yes, **I will**. / No, **I won't**.

**Lưu ý quan trọng:**
- Trong câu hỏi và câu trả lời ngắn khẳng định: KHÔNG dùng dạng rút gọn
- ✓ Yes, I **will**. 
- ✗ Yes, I**'ll**.

---

### 7. Một số lưu ý quan trọng

**1. Không dùng "will" trong mệnh đề if:**
- ✗ If you **will eat** healthy food, you will be strong.
- ✓ If you **eat** healthy food, you will be strong.

**2. Thì trong mệnh đề if:**
- Luôn dùng **Present Simple**, không dùng will
- If it **rains** tomorrow, we **won't go** to the beach.

**3. Unless (trừ khi):**
- Unless = If ... not
- You won't pass **unless** you study. = You won't pass **if** you **don't** study.
