# Unit 3: Carnival! 
## Comparative and Superlative Adjectives / Too and Enough

---

## PHẦN LÝ THUYẾT (Theory in Vietnamese)

### 1. Tính từ so sánh hơn (Comparative Adjectives)

**Công dụng:** Dùng để so sánh một người hoặc vật với một người hoặc vật khác.

**Cách thành lập:**

**A. Tính từ ngắn (1-2 âm tiết):**
- Thêm **-er** vào cuối tính từ + **than**
- Ví dụ: loud → **louder than** (ồn hơn)
- Ví dụ: pretty → **prettier than** (đẹp hơn)

**Lưu ý:**
- Tính từ có 1 nguyên âm + 1 phụ âm: nhân đôi phụ âm cuối (big → bigger)
- Tính từ kết thúc bằng -y: đổi y thành i rồi thêm -er (happy → happier)

**B. Tính từ dài (3+ âm tiết):**
- Dùng **more** + tính từ + **than**
- Ví dụ: This book is **more interesting than** that book. (Cuốn sách này thú vị hơn cuốn sách kia.)

**C. Trường hợp đặc biệt:**
- **more** (nhiều hơn) ↔ **less** (ít hơn)
- Ví dụ: That book is **less interesting than** this book.

### 2. Tính từ so sánh nhất (Superlative Adjectives)

**Công dụng:** Dùng để so sánh một người hoặc vật với cả nhóm người hoặc vật khác.

**Cách thành lập:**

**A. Tính từ ngắn (1-2 âm tiết):**
- **the** + tính từ + **-est**
- Ví dụ: loud → **the loudest** (ồn nhất)
- Ví dụ: pretty → **the prettiest** (đẹp nhất)

**B. Tính từ dài (3+ âm tiết):**
- **the most** + tính từ
- Ví dụ: **the most beautiful** (đẹp nhất)

**C. Trường hợp đặc biệt:**
- **the most** (nhiều nhất) ↔ **the least** (ít nhất)
- Ví dụ: **the least beautiful** (ít đẹp nhất)

---

### 3. As ... as ... (Bằng nhau)

**Công dụng:** Dùng để nói hai người hoặc vật ngang nhau về một đặc điểm nào đó.

**Cấu trúc:**
- **as + tính từ + as** (bằng nhau, ngang nhau)
- Ví dụ: This band's **as loud as** the last band! (Ban nhạc này ồn bằng ban nhạc trước!)

- **not as + tính từ + as** (không bằng, không ngang)
- Ví dụ: London is **not as big as** Cairo. (London không lớn bằng Cairo.)

---

### 4. Too and Enough (Quá và Đủ)

**A. TOO (Quá - mang nghĩa tiêu cực)**

**Cấu trúc:** **too + tính từ**
- Dùng để chỉ cái gì đó nhiều hơn mức cần thiết (thường có nghĩa tiêu cực)
- Ví dụ: That hat is **too big** for you! (Cái mũ đó quá to đối với bạn!)

**B. ENOUGH (Đủ - mang nghĩa tích cực)**

**Cấu trúc 1:** **adjective + enough**
- Đặt sau tính từ
- Ví dụ: It smells good **enough** to eat! (Nó có mùi thơm đủ để ăn!)

**Cấu trúc 2:** **enough + noun**
- Đặt trước danh từ
- Ví dụ: There's **enough cake** for everyone. (Có đủ bánh cho mọi người.)

**So sánh:**
- He's **too** old to be in the team. (Anh ấy QUÁ già để ở trong đội - không thể tham gia)
- These shoes aren't big **enough** for me. (Đôi giày này không đủ lớn cho tôi - quá nhỏ)
- Is there **enough** food for everyone? (Có đủ đồ ăn cho mọi người không?)
