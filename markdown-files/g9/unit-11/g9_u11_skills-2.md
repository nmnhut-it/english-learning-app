My favourite electronic device is a robotic vacuum cleaner which helps me to clean the floors, a laborious and boring task. First, it can automatically clean almost all dust, spots, and dirty marks in my house. Second, I can control it by using an app on my smartphone when I'm away from home. Finally, it's easy to store and carry my robotic vacuum cleaner because it's smaller than a normal vacuum cleaner. I think there'll be a lot of things that a robotic vacuum cleaner can do in the future. First, it'll be able to recognise patterns and then take action. It'll go to a place where you have eaten and suck up all the crumbs there. Second, it'll be able to climb stairs and even open doors or drawers. So it'll be able to get to any floor or room in our houses. Finally, laser technology will make it recognise anything on the ground like dust or dirt. With these improvements, I think robotic vacuum cleaners will be more helpful to us in the future.

1. My favourite electronic device is the smartphone.   
2. It helps me with learning everything   
3. In the future, it will help me take care of my home by controlling robots. 

The smartphone is my favorite electronic device.   
It's perfect for learning and entertainment. I can watch videos, play games, read books, and take online courses anytime.  
My smartphone keeps me connected through calls, texts, and social media. I can also use it to check the time, set alarms, and track my health basics like steps.  
With a smartphone, I can take photos, listen to music, and find directions. It fits in my pocket but holds a world of information.  
In the future, smartphones might get even smarter with better AI, longer battery life, and more health features.
