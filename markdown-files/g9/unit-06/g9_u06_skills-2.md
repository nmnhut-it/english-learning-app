Hi, Tom

Great to hear from you\! Here’s an update on my family over the past five years. We’re still a nuclear family with two generations, but our living conditions have improved. Two years ago, my dad got a new job with better pay. Now we have an air conditioner, a washing machine, and sometimes we eat out or go on trips. My dad also spends more time with my brother and me, teaching us things that men should know. We are more like friends now, and my parents respect our independence and privacy. Isn't that great?

Your friend, 

…..
