## ✍️ Sample Answer

In recent decades, the proliferation of social media platforms has fundamentally transformed how individuals interact and consume information worldwide. While these digital tools have undeniably facilitated global connectivity, I strongly agree that their detrimental effects on both individuals and society substantially outweigh their benefits.

The most concerning impact of social media lies in its profound psychological effects on users, particularly young people. Research has consistently correlated excessive platform usage with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant exposure to curated, idealized versions of others' lives exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and FOMO (fear of missing out). Moreover, the addictive nature of these platforms, designed to maximize user engagement through dopamine-triggering notifications and infinite scrolling, has created what experts term "digital addiction." This dependency not only undermines productivity but also impairs users' ability to engage in meaningful face-to-face interactions.

Furthermore, social media has contributed to the erosion of civil discourse and social cohesion. These platforms facilitate the rapid spread of misinformation, with false news traveling six times faster than truthful content according to MIT research. The algorithm-driven echo chambers reinforce existing biases, leading to unprecedented political polarization and radicalization. The pervasive nature of online harassment and cyberbullying has created toxic digital environments that spill over into real-world violence and discrimination. Additionally, privacy concerns regarding data harvesting and manipulation have undermined democratic processes, as evidenced by various election interference scandals.

In conclusion, while social media platforms were initially heralded as tools for democratizing communication, their negative implications for mental health, social harmony, and democratic integrity are increasingly evident. Addressing these concerns through stricter regulation and comprehensive digital literacy education has become paramount for protecting future generations.
