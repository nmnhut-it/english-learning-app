Dear Tom,  
Tet is coming. I will tell you more about our Tet.   
At Tet, we should **visit relatives with parents**. We should **wear beautiful clothes** too. But we shouldn't **break things**. We shouldn't **play cards all night**, either.  
Please write and tell me about your New Year celebration.  
Yours,

Nguyen
