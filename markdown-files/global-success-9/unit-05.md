**Different summer course experiences**

**Duong:** I had a hard 10-day course in an army camp in Son Tay last summer. Everything was different from my life at home. We had to wake up at 5 a.m. and attended classes which were like training courses for soldiers. In the evening, we read books or worked in teams. The team leaders guided us through many exciting activities. We also joined a performance that had the theme: environment protection. We could only call our parents once a day. We also had touching moments when we received letters from our parents. I have never attended a course which was so strict but exciting.

**Dương:** Tôi đã có một khóa học 10 ngày vất vả ở trại quân đội ở Sơn Tây vào mùa hè năm ngoái. Mọi thứ đều khác với cuộc sống ở nhà của tôi. Chúng tôi phải thức dậy lúc 5 giờ sáng và tham gia các lớp học giống như huấn luyện binh sĩ. Vào buổi tối, chúng tôi đọc sách hoặc làm việc theo nhóm. Các trưởng nhóm đã dẫn dắt chúng tôi tham gia nhiều hoạt động thú vị. Chúng tôi còn tham gia một tiết mục có chủ đề: bảo vệ môi trường. Chúng tôi chỉ có thể gọi điện cho bố mẹ một lần một ngày. Chúng tôi cũng có những giây phút cảm động khi nhận được thư của bố mẹ. Tôi chưa bao giờ tham dự một khóa học nào nghiêm khắc nhưng thú vị như vậy.

**Akiko:** I took an unforgettable summer course in the US. I stayed on Thornwood campus, on the outskirts of New York City, for three weeks. We had a campus tour which was fun, attended English classes, and joined team activities. We all tried to communicate in English. In the evening, we played board games and billiards. My most special experience was the visit to the top of Rockefeller Centre. From there, I could view the whole city below. It was the first time I travelled without my parents, so I felt like I grew up a lot after that trip.

**Akiko:** Tôi đã tham gia một khóa học mùa hè không thể quên ở Mỹ. Tôi ở trong khuôn viên trường Thornwood ở ngoại ô thành phố New York trong ba tuần. Chúng tôi đã có một chuyến tham quan khuôn viên trường thú vị, tham dự các lớp học tiếng Anh và tham gia các hoạt động nhóm. Tất cả chúng tôi đều cố gắng giao tiếp bằng tiếng Anh. Vào buổi tối, chúng tôi chơi trò chơi board game và bi-a. Trải nghiệm đặc biệt nhất là chuyến viếng thăm đỉnh Trung tâm Rockefeller. Từ đó, tôi có thể ngắm nhìn toàn cảnh thành phố bên dưới. Đó là lần đầu tiên tôi đi du lịch mà không có bố mẹ đi cùng nên tôi cảm thấy mình trưởng thành hơn rất nhiều sau chuyến đi.

**Sample answer:**
I still remember the most pleasant experience I have had at school. It was winning the English speaking competition last year. I had prepared for weeks, practicing my pronunciation and memorizing my speech. On the day of the competition, I was extremely nervous, but when I stood on stage, all my fears disappeared. I spoke confidently and clearly, and the audience listened attentively. When they announced that I had won first place, I couldn't believe it. The happiness of hearing my name and receiving the trophy was overwhelming. My classmates and teachers congratulated me warmly. This experience boosted my confidence and motivated me to participate in more school activities. It taught me that hard work and dedication always pay off.

Tôi vẫn nhớ trải nghiệm thú vị nhất tôi từng có ở trường. Đó là việc giành chiến thắng trong cuộc thi nói tiếng Anh năm ngoái. Tôi đã chuẩn bị trong nhiều tuần, luyện phát âm và học thuộc bài phát biểu. Vào ngày thi, tôi cực kỳ lo lắng, nhưng khi đứng trên sân khấu, mọi nỗi sợ hãi đều biến mất. Tôi nói một cách tự tin và rõ ràng, và khán giả lắng nghe chăm chú. Khi họ thông báo tôi đã giành giải nhất, tôi không thể tin được. Niềm vui khi nghe tên mình và nhận cúp thật tuyệt vời. Các bạn cùng lớp và thầy cô đã chúc mừng tôi nồng nhiệt. Trải nghiệm này đã tăng cường sự tự tin của tôi và thúc đẩy tôi tham gia nhiều hoạt động của trường hơn. Nó dạy tôi rằng sự chăm chỉ và cống hiến luôn được đền đáp.

Today, I want to share with you one of my most memorable experiences, which occurred last summer when I volunteered at a local animal shelter.

During my time at the shelter, I engaged in various activities such as cleaning cages, feeding the animals, taking dogs for walks, and assisting in organizing adoption events and fundraising activities to support the shelter's operations.

Volunteering at the animal shelter was an incredibly fulfilling experience for me. It filled me with a sense of immense joy and empathy. However, there were also moments of heartache, especially when witnessing the hardships some of the animals had endured.

This experience is my most memorable because it taught me the importance of compassion and responsibility towards animals. It also allowed me to contribute to a meaningful cause and make a positive impact on the lives of these vulnerable creatures.
