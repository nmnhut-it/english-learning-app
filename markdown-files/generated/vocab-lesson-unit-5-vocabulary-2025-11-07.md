<!-- Source: g10/grade-10-unit-5-communication-culture.md -->

A computer needs both hardware and software to run, but decisions about the hardware must be made before you buy a computer. Understanding some basic information about the hardware is very important and will help you decide on the most suitable computer for you.

• Processors: The processor controls all of the activities of a computer. Processor speed is often shown in gigahertz (GHz). High processor speed means that your computer can run faster.

• Random Access Memory, or RAM: It is displayed in gigabytes (GB). The RAM shows how powerful your computer is. The more RAM in a computer, the more tasks your computer can do at the same time.

• Storage space: It shows how much information (such as documents, music, photos, etc.) a computer can store. It is also displayed in gigabytes (GB). There is other information about the hardware, such as the screen size, the battery, and the weight, that you need to know before choosing the best computer for you.
