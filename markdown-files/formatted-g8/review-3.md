### ✍️ Writing - Viết
#### ✍️ Bài 4: Write a paragraph (80 - 100 words) about where your family shops and give reasons for your choice
(Viết đoạn văn (80 - 100 từ) kể về địa điểm mua sắm của gia đình em và nêu lí do lựa chọn)

**Writing prompt:** My family usually shops _______________________

**Sample answer 1:**
My family usually shops at the supermarket. The supermarket provides a wide range of goods which are displayed under one roof. This helps save a lot of time. If you go to a local market, you have to go to a lot of stores and stalls to buy stuff which is really time consuming and tiring. Another advantage of shopping in supermarket is that you can have more options for the same product for you to choose. For example, there are often one or two fixed brands of soap to choose in a store, but you can see about 10-15 brands of soaps if you go to the supermarket. To summarize, we like to shop in supermarket because of convenience and variety.

**Sample answer 2:**
My family usually shops at the open-air market in my neighbourhood. My mum goes shopping there once every two days. It is only about five minutes' walk from my home, so it is very convenient. There is a wide variety of goods, from groceries to vegetables, from clothes to kitchen utensils, etc. And their price is reasonable. Moreover, the food there is good and fresh as farmers bring their products to sell there every day. We are lucky to have a good shopping place nearby.
