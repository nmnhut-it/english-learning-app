**An exhibition of future cities**
*(Triển lãm về các thành phố tương lai)*

**Ms Smith**: Good morning. Welcome to our exhibition: Future Cities. Here you can see models of our cities of the future. Please take a look around and feel free to ask me any questions.

**Nam**: This model looks very interesting. Can you tell me more about it, Ms Smith?

**Ms Smith**: Yes. This is a 'green city' designed to reduce its negative impact on the environment. As you can see, more than fifty per cent of it is made up of green areas.

**Nam**: I don't see any private vehicles on the roads.

**Ms Smith**: Most people will use public transport such as trams and electric buses. There will be fewer traffic jams and less pollution.

**Nam**: So city dwellers will stop using their cars in urban areas.

**Ms Smith**: That's the idea.

**Nam**: I like it. It seems a good solution to many environmental problems.

(...)

**Mai**: Let's look at the city over there. I can see robots and lots of cameras in the streets. What's special about this city?

**Ms Smith**: It's called a 'smart city'. AI technologies, such as cameras and smart sensors, will be installed to help the city operate more efficiently.

**Mai**: The modern infrastructure of the city looks beautiful. I'm really impressed with the high-rise buildings.

**Ms Smith**: Tall buildings can actually limit the carbon footprint of the built environment and help solve housing problems in big cities.

**Mai**: Mmm, I'm thinking of living in a smart city in the future.

**Characteristics of future cities**
*(Những đặc điểm của các thành phố tương lai)*

By 2050 the world's population is expected to reach 10 billion, and nearly 70 per cent of these people will live in cities. The cities of the future will be 'smarter' and more sustainable to cope with a growing population and improve people's lives.

A smart city is a modern urban area that uses a range of technologies to provide services, solve problems, and support people better. The new technologies can help save time by predicting changes in the traffic and warning people of possible traffic jams. They will also help cities operate more efficiently. For example, street lights can turn off when the streets are empty, and sensors can inform waste collection teams when the bins are full. These smart technologies will help save energy, reduce air pollution, and fight climate change.

Cities in the future will also be sustainable. They will include a lot of green space and become home to more plants and animals. Making room for biodiversity and nature can be done in various ways including underground and rooftop farming, green roofs, and roof gardens. As people will care more about the environment, most cities will use renewable and clean energy. Modern infrastructure will also be more eco-friendly. Computer-controlled transport systems like electric buses and trains will produce less greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, more pedestrian zones for walking and cycle paths will be made available for people in all neighbourhoods.

These features will make future cities more liveable and will provide a high quality of life to city dwellers.

[1] Living in a smart city: GOOD or BAD?

[2] If you live in a smart city, you will probably agree with me that life is not all good as some people may think. So what are the pros and cons of living in a smart city?

[3] The good thing about smart cities is that they are very modern. Smart technologies make people's lives easier by reducing household chores. Besides, the city infrastructure which includes sensors and cameras collects information about people and their activities, and uses it to provide faster, cheaper, and better services.

[4] On the other hand, living in a smart city has some disadvantages. Some smart technologies are difficult to use and without training, city dwellers might find them useless. With cameras everywhere in public spaces, people also have limited privacy. They are worried that their personal information might not be protected, and they might become victims of cybercrime.

[5] In conclusion, living in a smart city has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I think these urban areas offer great promise. The issues should be dealt with in the years ahead as the world's population keeps growing, and more people are moving to big cities.
