***Ms Hoa:*** Good moming, class. There was an education fair last weekend. Did anyone go?

***Nam:*** Yes, Mai and I did. The fair was great, and we got a lot of useful information.

***Ms Hoa:*** I'm glad to hear that. Would you like to share some of it with the class?

***Mai:*** Sure. After finishing school, we mainly have two education options. For example, we can get into university if we earn high grades or pass the university entrance exam.

***Nam:*** That's true, but academic education isn’t everything. The other option is going to a vocational school where we can learn skills for particular jobs.

***Ms Hoa:*** That sounds interesting. So what are your plans for the future?

***Mai:*** I'm hoping to go to university. Having won several biology competitions, I want to study biology and become a scientist.

***Ms Hoa:*** Great! It’s really important to follow your dream, Mai.

***Mai:*** My mum still regrets not having gone to university. So I want to make her proud of me. How about you, Nam?

***Nam:*** Well, I don’t think university is for me. I want to go to a vocational school because I want to become a car mechanic. My father owns a car repair shop. Having watched him work very hard for many years helped me make my decision.

***Ms Hoa:*** That's very sensible, Nam! I hope you can help him grow his business.

**Phương pháp giải:**

**Tạm dịch:**

*Cô Hoa: Chúc cả lớp vui vẻ. Có một hội chợ giáo dục vào cuối tuần trước. Có ai đi không?*

*Nam: Vâng, Mai và tôi đã làm. Hội chợ thật tuyệt vời và chúng tôi đã nhận được rất nhiều thông tin hữu ích.*

*Cô Hoa: Tôi rất vui khi nghe điều đó. Bạn có muốn chia sẻ một số điều đó với cả lớp không?*

*Mai: Chắc chắn rồi. Sau khi học xong, chúng tôi chủ yếu có hai lựa chọn giáo dục. Ví dụ, chúng ta có thể vào đại học nếu chúng ta đạt điểm cao hoặc vượt qua kỳ thi tuyển sinh đại học.*

*Nam: Đúng vậy, nhưng giáo dục học thuật không phải là tất cả. Lựa chọn khác là đến một trường dạy nghề, nơi chúng ta có thể học các kỹ năng cho những công việc cụ thể.*

*Cô Hoa: Nghe thú vị đấy. Vì vậy, kế hoạch của bạn cho tương lai là gì?*

*Mai: Tôi hy vọng được vào đại học. Giành chiến thắng trong một số cuộc thi sinh học, tôi muốn học sinh học và trở thành một nhà khoa học.*

*Cô Hoa: Tuyệt vời! Điều thực sự quan trọng là theo đuổi giấc mơ của bạn, Mai.*

*Mai: Mẹ tôi vẫn tiếc vì đã không học đại học. Vì vậy, tôi muốn làm cho cô ấy tự hào về tôi. Còn bạn thì sao Nam?*

*Nam: Chà, tôi không nghĩ đại học là dành cho tôi. Tôi muốn học trường dạy nghề vì tôi muốn trở thành thợ sửa xe. Bố tôi sở hữu một cửa hàng sửa chữa ô tô. Chứng kiến anh ấy làm việc rất chăm chỉ trong nhiều năm đã giúp tôi đưa ra quyết định của mình.*

*Cô Hoa: Hay lắm đấy Nam! Tôi hy vọng bạn có thể giúp anh ấy phát triển công việc kinh doanh của mình.*
