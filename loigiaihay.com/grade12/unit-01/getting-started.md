***Mark:*** Hi, Nam. Your book must be very interesting. What are you reading?

***Nam:*** I'm reading a really good book in English called *Last Night I Dreamed of Peace: The Diary of Dang Thuy Tram.*

***Mark:*** Dang Thuy Tram? Who is she?

***Nam:*** She was born in Hue in 1942. She studied medicine in Ha Noi, and volunteered to join the army at the age of 24, working as a surgeon during the resistance war against the US.

***Mark:*** That's when she started her diary, isn't it?

***Nam:*** Yes. She wrote her diary while she was working in a field hospital in Quang Ngai Province. The diary contains personal accounts of her experiences during the war and shows her love for her family and country.

***Mark:*** Wow! It sounds interesting. Is she still alive?

***Nam:*** Unfortunately, she was killed by the enemy while she was doing her duty in the jungle in Quang Ngai Province. She was only 27 then.

***Mark:*** Oh, that's really sad. But how did people find her diary?

***Nam:*** An American soldier found it and saved it from being burnt. Then more than 30 years after Tram's death, a copy was returned to her mother. The diary was published in Viet Nam in 2005. It has also been translated into several other languages.

***Mark:*** That's amazing!

***Nam:*** Now she is considered a national hero for devoting her youth and whole life to saving other people's lives in the war.

***Mark:*** Can you lend me the book when you finish reading it? I'd like to read it myself.

***Nam:*** Sure!

**Phương pháp giải:**

**Tạm dịch:**

*Mark: Chào Nam. Cuốn sách của bạn chắc hẳn rất thú vị. Bạn đang đọc gì thế?*

*Nam: Tôi đang đọc một cuốn sách Tiếng Anh rất hay có tên Đêm qua tôi mơ thấy hòa bình: Nhật ký Đặng Thùy Trâm.*

*Mark: Đặng Thùy Trâm? Bà ấy là ai vậy?*

*Nam: Bà sinh ra ở Huế năm 1942. Bà học y ở Hà Nội, và tình nguyện nhập ngũ năm 24 tuổi, làm bác sĩ phẫu thuật trong thời kỳ kháng chiến chống Mỹ.*

*Mark: Đó là lúc bà ấy bắt đầu viết nhật ký đúng không?*

*Nam: Đúng vậy. Bà viết nhật ký khi đang làm việc tại bệnh viện dã chiến ở tỉnh Quảng Ngãi. Cuốn nhật ký chứa đựng lời kể cá nhân về những trải nghiệm của bà trong chiến tranh và thể hiện tình yêu của bà ấy đối với gia đình và đất nước.*

*Mark: Ôi! Nghe thật thú vị. Bà ấy vẫn còn sống à?*

*Nam: Không may thay, bà bị địch giết khi đang làm nhiệm vụ trong rừng ở tỉnh Quảng Ngãi. Lúc đó bà mới 27 tuổi.*

*Mark: Ồ, buồn thật đấy. Nhưng làm thế nào mọi người tìm thấy nhật ký của bà vậy?*

*Nam: Một người lính Mỹ đã tìm thấy và cứu nó khỏi đám cháy. Sau hơn 30 năm sau khi bà Trâm qua đời, một bản sao được trả lại cho mẹ bà. Cuốn nhật ký được xuất bản ở Việt Nam vào năm 2005. Nó cũng đã được dịch sang nhiều thứ tiếng khác.*

*Mark: Thật tuyệt vời!*

*Nam: Bây giờ bà ấy được coi là anh hùng dân tộc vì đã cống hiến tuổi trẻ và cả cuộc đời mình để cứu mạng người khác trong chiến tranh.*

*Mark: Bạn có thể cho tôi mượn cuốn sách khi bạn đọc xong được không? Tôi muốn tự mình đọc nó.*

*Nam: Chắc chắn rồi!*
